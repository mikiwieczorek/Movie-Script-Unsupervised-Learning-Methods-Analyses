HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY Written by Douglas Adams Based on the book "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams Revisions by Karey Kirkpatrick 8/8/03 It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate. The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means. The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but in fact the message was this... "So long and thanks for all the fish." ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight.  What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast! Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever. I'm game. We'll see who rusts first. This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago. The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me.  Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year. On display? I had to go down to a cellar! That's the display department. I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'. Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you? How much? None at all.  Arthur! Ford? Arthur! There you are. Here drink and eat with me. We need to talk. Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home, Whoa.   You already know? How?  Oh. When you say "they" you mean they. Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you something important, and I gotta tell you now. But what about my house? C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers. Can we trust him? I'd trust him to the end of the Earth. And how far's that? About twelve minutes away. Six pints of bitter. And quickly.      The world's about to end. Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it. Well, when does he get back from lunch? Or is he going straight out for tea?! This is shaping up to be a crap day.  It's about to get a lot crappier. There you are, six pints. Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to spend it. Three? At lunchtime? Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. Very deep. You should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you. Drink up. Why three pints? Muscle relaxant.  And eat these. You'll need the salt. What's going on. Ford? What would you say if I told you I wasn't really from Guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Eetelgeuse? Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say? Remember when we met? That car was racing toward me, I was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way? Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand to a fast approaching car. Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him out of the way as the car zooms past. Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car? I assumed you were drunk.  I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself. And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies?  You saved my life that day.      Now I'm saving yours. Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer. This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays. Look, if it's about your house... No, it's not that.    It's.... He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone. I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about? This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes. Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.  Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party. At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember? I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don't know, brush the dog. Anything. But there I was -- and then, there she was... Who are you? I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent. No, I mean who are you? Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...  Livingston, I presume.  Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice. You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock. Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.  Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology... I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that! And just as I was asking myself, "Why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says... Let's go somewhere. Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner... I was thinking Madagascar. Is that a new club on Dean Street? No. It's a country.    Off the coast of Africa. Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then.  Good God, you're serious.  CONTINUED:                                                     9 She nods.    Arthur isn't sure how to react. Well...that's...an extraordinary proposition. But...I can't just up and go. What about my job? Quit.   Get a new one when we return. I can't just...what about my house?     Who would feed my dog? Bring him with. He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of place in Madagascar. Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed. You don't want to go to Madagascar. They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming, extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash... Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy -- of course, you probably already know that. I'm headed for a lost and distant planet. Would you like to see my spaceship? I went to refresh our drinks.     When I came back, she was gone. Arthur stares into his beer, plagued by this loss. "Would you like to see my spaceship?" Really, what sort of chat up line is that? More popular than you'd think. I've left messages, sent letters... It's like she's vanished off the face of the earth.  11. Hey, it happens. Speaking of... device from his satchel) We've got two minutes. So drink up. There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside. Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up. My house! He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket. A round for everyone, on me. You really think the world's going to end?  Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something? If you want. Will it help? Not really. He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits. Last orders, then? Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance. STOP!   STOP, YOU BASTARDS!! Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY. block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is blown sideways. Trees are uprooted. Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.  Another ship screams over, blowing them down again. Rain is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big THWUMP! Everywhere is soaked. Ships from a Vogon Constructor Fleet. I picked up their signal this morning. He shows Arthur his blinking Sens-0-Matic device. Here.   You'll need this. He tosses Arthur the towel. Then, he removes a short black rod, his ELECTRONIC THUMB. He sticks it out. Picture mission control in Houston. WORKERS scramble. Monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports from around the globe; panic, chaos and pandemonium. Suddenly, there's a loud HUM through the speakers, followed by loud GARGLES and SCREECHING. Then... People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning council. A FAMILY at breakfast, baffled that their cutlery, bowls and glasses resonate with the sound of Jeltz's voice. As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system... Several PATRONS watch the wall of TV's, all projecting a snowy, distorted image. Jeltz's voice blares through the speakers. ...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you. Through the window behind them, throngs of people stampede down Oxford Street, screaming. A TECHNICIAN speaks urgently into a microphone while his co-workers watch the chaos on the monitors behind. Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond! The VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda. There's no point in acting all surprised about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints. Ford grabs hold of Arthur's shirt, extends the Thumb.  What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout. Jeltz turns.   He's large, green and walrusy. Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams. One of his walrusy FIRST OFFICERS pushes a yellow button. As all the Vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light. Glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward Earth. On impact, they bore into the surface. Detonate.  Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses in on itself. Gone. The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS. see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY." The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book... The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons. ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations... More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, PERSON, ANYWAY? Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial. In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in large friendly letters on its cover. The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee. blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face. Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide. So you're not from Guilford, which would explain the accent -- which I've always wondered about...and you're not an out of work actor -- but rather a writer for this...this...book thing. Ford nods.    Arthur rubs his weary brow. I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea. Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts. Here. Eat these. If you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein. Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels his way around the room, looking for something. If I asked where we were would I regret We're safe. For now. Good. We're in a storage hold in one of               the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet ... Obviously some strange usage of the word safe I wasn't previously aware of.  Is it? Tell me you're joking. Okay. I'm joking. And do a reassuring little laugh. Ford does a reassuring little laugh. Now tell me where we really are.  In the storage hold of a Vogon constructor ship. Ford continues his search.   Arthur's breathing quickens. Get me home. Ford. Home? Arthur...your home... is... Oh God - it was demolished! I've got to reach my lawyer! He must be back from lunch by now... He pulls out his cell phone. Desperately punches numbers. Ford flips on a light switch, revealing a messy chamber full of alien junk and old mattresses. You don't remember, do you?  Okay. I've got something to tell you. It ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay? Good god. Is this really the interior of a flying saucer? Yeah. Why? Well, it's a bit squalid isn't it? Hey man, you're in denial. Jeltz consults one screen after another. At last he sees Ford and Arthur. His walrusy eyes narrow. Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn't you have done something?!! I did.   I saved you.  But there's six billion other people. And all those ants. Yes, but ants aren't exactly people! And now you're thinking like a Vogon.  I saved your life, okay? Which makes us even. Next thing. Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused. It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive out here, you really gotta know where your towel is. Now gimme a hand over here. Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe. Careful, it's hot. He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of it, Arthur does the same. We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull. They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe. What's a Vogon? Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons." Ford continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide. "Vogons." The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision. Vogons.  CHARACTER, HISTORY, HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH, HOW TO ANNOY, Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. Arthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.' The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat. Arthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'. On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you. They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things.  And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty. It can't be gone. It can't be! Earth! Shhh! EARTH!! Earth. An image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen. Harmless. Arthur waits...and waits.    The Earth image fades away.  That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?" Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded. What does it say now? Mostly harmless. Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears. Ahhh, what the hell is that?! Here.   Put this in your ear. Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles. WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH... The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to get the fish in Arthur's ear. Argh!   What's happening...? As he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's voice. Arthur looks incredulous. This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention! The fish. It's translating for you. According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and...  Arthur doesn't want to hear any of this...pulls the fish back out of his ear. Ford struggles, shoves it back in Arthur's ear again. ...and this is not a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders. The door BURSTS open. A VOGON GUARD enters. Grabs Ford and Arthur. They struggle. Resistance is useless! The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door, Arthur continues to try to yank the fish out of his ear. Ford wrestles with him, trying to keep it in. The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. A bleak corridor. The Vogon guard pushes a still struggling Arthur and Ford down it. It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain, the practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand anything said to you in any language. Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal window. He backs up to look out. Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable thing that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved in the Universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see this as a final clinching proof of the NON-existence of God. purple-orange clouds of swirling stars and gasses. The argument goes something like this... "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."  It's finally sinking in -- he's in deep space. "But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead give-away. It proves you exist, and so therefore you don't. QED." "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic. The guard yanks Arthur away, pushes him forward with Ford. Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, 'WELL THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP FOR GOD.' Arthur looks lost and confused. They approach a set of double doors. He stops. The Guard shoves him forward. Resistance is useless! Ford... Don't panic. If we're lucky, they'll throw us out into space. And if we're unlucky? Off Ford's apprehensive look we CUT TO... Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars with hundreds of elastic bands. A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM! Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it. We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is. He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " -- smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry. Oh freddled gruntbuggly! Thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee. Ford WRITHES in pain, as does Arthur but less so.  Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe. Ford VIBRATES like he's having an epileptic seizure. Arthur just looks like he has a migraine. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Spasms wrack Ford's body.    He SCREAMS.     Arthur squints. Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't! Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp. Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends. The absolute worst poetry was written by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix. It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it was destroyed when the Earth was. So, Earthlings, I present you with a simple choice. Either die in the vacuum of space, or -- tell what you thought of my poem. Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up. Actually...I rather liked it. Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur. Good tact. Run with it. Um...some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective. Continue. . .  And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity... Vogonity! ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er... ... whatever it was ... ... the poem was about. Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly. Damn. What? I think you just saved my life again. An astute analysis. Very impressive.  Throw them off the ship. The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge. Resistance is useless! Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor..." Death's too good for them. Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab. The Guard shoves them into the airlock. They sit, panting.    Arthur stares forward. So this is it? We're going to die?  Yes. No, wait! What's this switch?  No, it's nothing. We are going to die. Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself. You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young. Why? What did you she tell you? I don't know. I didn't listen. Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help? You're sweating. Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then -- PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out. Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket. "Space..." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space..." and so on. The weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it. The words "DON'T PANIC" alight. It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against...  Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress party. ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to connect with. He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips. His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away. hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD. Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling... In the middle of this hi-tech receiving bay sit two ornate golden brocade sofas.  Two to the power of ten thousand to one against and falling. The sofas shake a little. Ford... Yes? I think I'm a sofa. I think I know how you feel. A long pause. Both sofas begin to thrash in panic. Five to one against and falling... A pair of arms and legs pop out of each sofa. Four to one against and falling... ...and of course, the top story is still the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of Gold last week, stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. So, in the name of the people and freedom and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like that, I hereby declare this ship officially stolen! TV, watching with a very satisfied grin... Three to one...two to one... Annoyed, he turns. There's a woman with red hair , her back to him, reading numbers off a console display and speaking into a microphone.  Probability factor of one to one...we have normality, I repeat we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon. Hey.   Do you mind?   I can't hear. the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright red. She looks amazing. Can we put your ego aside for one moment? Something important has happened. If there's anything more important than my ego on this ship, I want it caught and shot now. He turns back to the TV and turns it up. ...the question everyone seems to be asking is, has the Big Z finally flipped? We asked his private brain care Specialist, Gag Halfrunt... Vell, Zaphod's just zis guy, you know --  The TV suddenly clicks off.    Zaphod spins.    Trillian's holding a remote. Hey... We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay. His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his hands and shoves it back down. I didn't pick them up. The ship did. Huh? When you engaged the Improbability Drive. I didn't engage the drive. We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha -- where you picked me up. That's impossible. No.    Just very, very improbable. I don't have time for this! We've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, eh? He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      She stops him. Don't. I'll send Marvin.  Marvin! Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump- shouldered toward Zaphod. I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed. We have something to take your mind off things.  It won't work, I have an exceptionally large mind. I know. Go down to the number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here. Just that? Yes. I won't enjoy it. She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do it will you? All right. I'll do it. Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again. I'm not getting you down at all am I? No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just part of life. Life.   Don't talk to me about life. Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does. Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh! The Heart of Gold cruises around a bright star. A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ  appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at Command Headquarters. Commander Kwaltz. We've located the spaceship Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox. Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. Requesting hyperspace clearance.  Hold your position, captain, until clearance is granted. Kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table. Get me the vice-president. Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers. Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the next. He hands them back to the messengers jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The Hyperspace permission granted, Captain. A hundred rectangular vogon ships blast forward. Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff. Now this is more like my idea of a spaceship. Look at all these buttons... Shhh. They listen.    Hear footsteps. This way. He pushes a button. The door slides open with a satisfied sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through... Thank you for using this door. I've enjoyed opening for you. Hhmmyaahh... They leap through to the other side as the door closes. Ghastly, isn't it? They whip around to find Marvin standing before them.  I've been ordered to take you up to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? - 'cause I don't. Marvin turns and walks away. They shrug to each other and follow. Marvin passes through another door that opens with the same sigh -- "Hhmmaaaahhh" What a pleasure it is to open for you. I will gladly close for you now. The door closes. "All the doors in this spacecraft have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done. The door repeats its whole closing and opening routine again. Hateful, isn't it? You can thank the Marketing Division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation for building robots with GPP. GPP? "Genuine People Personalities." I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you? Er. . . Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway, so I don't know why I even bother to say it. Oh god, I'm so depressed. They round a corner...  And then I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side. I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens. Really? Wonder why?  Probably because he's so negative. Yes, I know. I was being...never mind. They continue on. featuring Zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake politicians smile. Tilt down to the door which opens - "Mmyyahhh!" - to reveal Ford, Arthur and Marvin. I've brought the aliens.    Don't thank me or anything. Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but sporting that same politically correct smile. Freeze! Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.      Marvin doesn't. Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing? I wasn't talking to you. Zaphod? Ixxie?    It is you!   IXXIE! Zaphod gives Ford a big bear hug. He pulls away, then playfully punches Ford in the arm. Praxibetel Ix, you zarking hoopy!     What the hell are you doing here? I don't know! Just stuck out the thumb and here I am.  That is so you. And look at you! President? Last time I saw you, you were a beach bum. Is it a great galaxy or what?  I still can't believe this. Ixxie!    Here! Hey, it's Ford now. Hmm? My name. It's Ford Prefect. Picked it up on Earth. Sorta grew on me. Okay "Ford" -- you zarking frood. They embrace, tussle, punch arms. They bump into Arthur. Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half brother? He shares three of the same mothers as me. We've met. Have we? Sorry. I've got a terrible memory for species. Before Arthur can explain, Trillian enters. Everything okay? Hey, hon. Come here. You won't believe this. Ix...um, sorry..."Ford"...this is... Tricia McMillan? She takes a closer look at him. Arthur?  Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a friendly embrace.  I can't believe this...I've been looking...and you're here? I went to get wine and... I know. And it was rude to just leave, but I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside, well, honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type.  But you're here... Arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret... Actually -- I am that type. But...well you do know what happened, don't you? Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur. --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride, and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember? I stole a ship? We're having a bit of a chat if you don't mind. Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly, Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots all the up way revealing a second head that lives somewhere under his chin. You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up or I'll kick you in the gones! There's the Zaphod I remember. Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists. Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur buckles and hits the floor. You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford. He's a guest on my ship. I thought you said you stole it.  Fine.   Get technical. A KLAXON sounds. Red lights FLASH. Zaphod  hurries to the console. Ford follows. Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw. Are you all right? I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn't even your name. It is my name. I shortened it. Trillian...! Well, I'm still Arthur. Just plain average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint. A little help over here? Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a missile! DO SOME DAMAGE! Zaphod's arms struggle with his head again. A dull gray rectangular Vogon BATTLE CRUISER is easing up behind the Heart of Gold. Behind the cruiser is about Computer? A very eager male COMPUTER VOICE  sounds. Hi, guys, this is Eddie your shipboard computer and I just know I'm gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me. Can you identify our pursuers?  I'd be happy to! Stand by, please.  Hey, guys, I'm just pleased as punch to report that it's a fleet of a hundred Vogon Battle Destroyers. You must be super important to warrant such an effort, and gee am I impressed. They're sending a message. I'd be super happy to play it. Fine! Play it!!  This people personality thing is gonna drive me nuts! Can't you change it? An IMAGE APPEARS on the ship's monitor - Vice President, H.Q.). He looks reluctant. He has to say this... This is Vice President Questular Rontok. I am speaking to the kidnapper of the President. Surrender your stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic Interstellar Space Bi-Laws. Leap to hyperspace! Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you we need proper authorization before entering a hyperspace expressway. Or else what? They'll send a hundred and one ships? DO it! He and Trillian buckle up. Ford turns to Arthur. Brace yourself.   This is a bit like being drunk. What's so bad about being drunk? Ask a glass of water. They are stretched and squeezed by extraordinary forces. Questular and Kwaltz watch their front screen as the Heart of Gold blasts into hyperspace.  Did they have proper hyperspace authorization? No, Commander. Add that to their list of offences!  Blatant disregard for protocol. You do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do. Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President.     And they are made to be followed. Questular looks up to the screen at all the Vogon ships. Don't you think this many ships is a bit, oh I don't know -- excessive? The provisions are clear. Under subsection 37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping- He holds up one fat official book with one hand. -- and these are the forces we deploy to apprehend any intentional or actual kidnapper. He holds up another fat book with the other. You are aware, Commander, that the President kidnapped himself. Hence... He puts the two books together, slams them down. Do you have any idea how ridiculous this is? I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President.     I just do what I do. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the top sheet, removes the pink copy. Folds it.  He does this for the other two forms as well. Questular watches dumbfounded as Kwaltz hands the papers back to the messenger who turns and runs off. The Heart of Gold comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed...alone. No Vogons in sight. Zaphod's Head 2 is still up, beaming. Damn, I'm good. Hands slam Head 2 down.         Zaphod  turns to Ford. So -- you along for the ride or am I dropping you somewhere?  Depends. Where you going? Into the pages of history, cousin. And when you see what I'm about to show you, you'll beg me to take you with us. You okay? Normally I would say "I'll live," but given the circumstances...  Is there any tea on this spaceship? This way. She exits.    Arthur follows.       Zaphod steps back, blocking his way. Hey, apeman. Earthman.      I'm sorry, what was your name again? Arthur.  Right.   No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to hear about your planet, but don't mention it to the girl because if you do I'll...I'll... He smiles broader.    Then Head 2 pops up and finishes... I'll pull your spleen out through your ass! Zaphod slams Head 2 back into place..then smiles again. Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian. Two heads. Interesting choice. Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain. So you carved it up? Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is--  --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that's when I realized I had this. He points to the COBALT BLUE CUBE on his gold necklace. flows into it a Martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog. Arthur removes the glass.    Sips.     Grimaces I suppose I should have said it resembles tea. So two heads is what does it for a girl, then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or three? Or your own space ship.  Anything else he's got two of? Come on, Arthur, don't be like that. Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green? Bleeping? What? Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it hurt? No, I suppose it wouldn't.. I mean... She points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her BACKPACK. I might have an aspirin. She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail. Hey.   What are they doing in there? Before she can catch them, they scurry under the door. They were from my lab at university.    Odd... So all that's left is me and you, "mostly harmless," and two lab rats. She furrows her brow.     What does he mean? Look, there's something I should tell you... Showtime, Trill! Can it keep? You might want to see this. Arthur nods. She leaves.        He looks at his "tea", throws it in the trash bin. Trillian and Arthur join Ford and Zaphod at the computer. --and when I saw what I'm about to show you, that's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain -- or it least, I think that's why. The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub- title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO... A procession surrounds a CHARIOT. Two young philosophers, The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and Fook dismount and approach.  What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence? Your task, O computer... Hang on. Did you say second greatest? Second greatest. Yes. But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could... You're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond? The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus, mention it not. The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?  The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards. Then what's the problem? I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.  Let's just ask the question. Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We want you to tell us -- the Answer. Long pause.    Deep Thought bleeps and bloops. The Answer...to what? You know. The answer.      To Life...the Universe...Everything. We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it? The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I'll have to think about it. Lunkwill glances at his time piece, Fook at the expectant throng behind them. They wait. Return to this place in exactly... seven and a half million years. What?! PSSSH.   The screen goes to snow. Ford and Arthur look confused. That's it?  No, no.    There's more.   They go back. Seven and a half million years later? Zaphod nods, hits play.       We PUSH BACK IN ON THE SCREEN. Lunkwill and Fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a crowd. They have beards and look like they're in their 40's. Deep Thought rises, looks lifeless. WORRIED MUTTERS Can I help you? Deep Thought.    Do you have... An answer for you? Yes. I have. There really is an answer? Yes. There really is one.  Oh! Can you tell us what it is? Yes. Though I don't think you're going to like it. Doesn't matter! We must know it! You're really not going to like it. Tell us! Alright. The answer to the ultimate question ... Yes ...  ... of Life, the Universe, and Everything ... Yes! ... is ... Yes ...!  Forty two. The surrounding crowd is stunned.    More MUTTERING. I checked it thoroughly. It would have been simpler, of course, to have known what the actual question was. But it was the Question. The Ultimate Question! Yes, but what actually is it? Everything! You know ... just EVERYTHING! That's not a question. Only when you know what the actual question will you know what the answer means. Give us the Ultimate Question then!! I can't.  But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for you. And it shall be called... The picture distorts and whites out.    PSSSSHHHHHH. Zaphod hits eject.    The blue cube rises. That's it? That's it. You're looking for the Ultimate Question? Yep. You. Me. Why? No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two." Doesn't work.  Let's get her ready, babe. He moves to a different rack of instruments, consults a check list, starts flipping some switches. I mean, why do you want to know the Ultimate Question? Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's for the fame and the money. He continues preparing the ship. Trillian consults the huge MANUAL, turning dials, flipping switches... But -- you're President of the Galaxy, aren't you? Yes, Arman. Arthur. Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I find the Question, that's permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep. Win-win.  But you don't know the name of the computer that other computer was talking about. Which is why I'm going there. Where? There. To find Deep Thought.    On Magrathea. Magrathea!? Magrathea is a myth, a legend... No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.  You mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become President so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship...so you could steal it... so you could go to Magrathea -- which, according to most sane people, doesn't even exist? Yep. Beautiful. Why this ship? What's so special about it? Zaphod thinks again -- hard. I don't seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets. Because of this, obviously. They turn to see Trillian flipping open a glass lid revealing a BIG RED BUTTON. Ford reads the glowing letters above the button...   Infinite Improbability Drive?       So they finally built one that works.       And that's how we got picked up. Exactly. And I'm guessing if we hit that button -- we go to Magrathea. You're guessing? Hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's the door. Now who's in? For a trip to a place that doesn't exist? I'm in. My editor will think I'm crazy, but what the hell -- he already thinks I'm dead. He takes out the Guide.       Zaphod looks to Trillian. Definitely. I'm in. They're all standing together. They turn to Arthur. Arthur looks to Trillian. She stares back -- waiting. Do I even have a choice? Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery. No! Arthur looks at the button. What exactly does an Infinite Improbability Drive do? Suddenly, Zaphod's Head 2 shoots up! THIS!! Zaphod's third arm shoots out and smacks the button. Improbability Drive Effect -- as the ship flips across space and disappears, leaving nothing but shimmers.  The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable Universe almost simultaneously, then selects the appropriate re-entry point. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub- Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were of course well understood. Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed. Vogon controllers and copilots turn dials and push buttons, scrambling to regain a signal. Such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy. Kwaltz and Questular appear on the monitor. Well, Captain...? Controllers turn more dials, trying to find the ship. Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. We had them sir. These are the coordinates. But -- they're not here. I can see that.     WHERE ARE THEY? The captain shrugs.    Kwaltz heaves a walrusy sigh. We hover above a greenish/purplish planet. materialize, something big and gray - tumbling toward us. We now see the big, gray thing is a GIANT RHINOCEROS -- which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the Heart of Gold. A knitted version of Arthur, Trillian, Ford and Zaphod sit in chairs before the ships console.  Is this going to happen every time we hit that button? Very probably, yes. former selves. Arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a sick expression, looks up to the screen. Did it work? Are we there? Now Zaphod looks -- and he's elated. Yes!...I think.     Computer? Hi, fella! Head 2 suddenly springs up. Can you please change that zarking annoying voice!!? Computer? What planet is that, please? CHECKING!! On-hold Muzak plays. They all sit and listen for a few beats, then Arthur yelps... OW!!  Did you just pluck a hair from my head? Yeah, as if, apeman.  Arthur suddenly feels something on his back, leaps out of the chair and brushes it off. The two mice land on the floor across the ship, then scurry away down a hallway. Before Arthur can react... Thanks for waiting, everyone. I'm just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6. Humma Kavula! Vogon crew quickly enter data. A FLIGHT ENGINEER gets something on his screen, shows it to the Captain. Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue? That is not a request to which I can respond, captain. Should I pursue what? Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so that you may pursue the fugitive? Yes, commander. Then you must say that, captain -- in request form. Requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue the fugitive, sir. Thank you. Request acknowledged.   Await response.  Bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms. The war room is silent. We hear the sound of running above. The footsteps hurry all the way around, we hear a door open, running up more steps, along the corridor until and finally an exhausted Vogon Messenger bursts through the door holding a blue form. Questular shakes his head in disbelief as Kwaltz signs the request form.  This is ridiculous! What do you need, an executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop doing this! Go and get him! According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2, you're not authorized to make such an order. But I'm acting president! Then act like a president, and do nothing. Kwaltz continues to fill out the forms. Questular grabs a clump of his hair -- and pulls it out. All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog? Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead of the other three. Humma Kavula! Why does he keep saying that? I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him this way. You mean fully clothed? She stops, fires him a look. Sorry, but I can't for the life of me figure out why you, the most brilliant woman I have ever met, have ended up with that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid politician! I mean, look at him! They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.  Clearly unlike any guy I've ever met.  Look, if you're going to pout your way around space, then maybe you should just go home. I can't. That's the whole point -- and I've been trying to tell you...  Hey, look what I found in the guide. He hands the guide to Trillian. She keeps walking. I wouldn't tell her if I were you. She deserves to know. But if you tell her and she ends up with you because you're literally the last guy on Earth -- you'll always doubt her intentions. Arthur considers this.      Nods. Got your towel? Do I need it? Only always. Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian down the mist covered street. She's reading the guide. In the beginning, the universe was created. This made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. Zaphod continues several steps ahead of them. Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle 6 firmly believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear   of the time they call "The Coming of Great White Handkerchief" are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each. ...who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. Humma Kavula! SLAM.   Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down. I'll handle this. The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him something, oozing charm. The creature points down the street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on. The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing: The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant arches" are the nostrils. Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large nostril/arches. A rush of air blows the mist past Ford, Trillian and Arthur a few steps behind. They stop. A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white robe and night-vision sun glasses. The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are you ready? Let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us. Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward. Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays. Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our noses, clogged and unblown in reverence to you. Zaphod stops a few feet away from Humma's chair. Hello, Humma.  That's Humma Kavula? I thought he was just using a swear word.  Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election. Something happened during the campaign. Zaphod never forgave him. What was it? Ford shrugs.    HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.  Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may wipe us clean. We ask this in your precious holy name... Achoo. And they all sneeze. Akin to crossing himself, Humma raises a hand to his nose, then down again. Bless you. Humma's quarters are opulent. He sits behind his desk flanked by several ARMED BODY GUARDS. Ford, Arthur and Trillian keep a safe distance as Zaphod faces off with Humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man. Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President. The Arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you. What brings you to our humble planet? I think you know why I'm here. I don't think I do. Oh, I think you think you don't, but we both know -- you do. Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze.  Head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all. You called me stupid!  Interesting. And I don't know what you're talking about. During the campaign, Humma -- you said I was stupid. This Humma you speak of no longer exists. He came here in his consolation position as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways. He now goes by the holy name Tazelo the Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his devoted followers. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place. Thank you. The 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD picks it up. Why do I get the feeling he's going to get us all killed? Probably because it's very possible.    Just don't save me, okay? We're even. Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches the end of the table.  The election is ancient history, Zaphod, but if memory serves -- you won, proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and ability to govern. A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage. And incidently -- you are stupid. His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile. That's really not the point. You haven't come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you here, Zaphod? Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.  I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea, I ended up here. How very, very...  ...improbable. He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest. I kept a few souvenirs from my former life. Ah, the heady days of space piracy... so young, so foolish.., Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma removes a PINK CUBE  I'll gladly give you the coordinates to Magrathea... He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF Humma takes it back... ...provided you bring me something in return.  What? A gun. A gun? A very special gun. Designed by the greatest computer ever invented, now buried in the bowels of Magrathea. Fine. I'll get your gun.    Just give me the coordinates. Zaphod reaches out.    Humma pulls it back. And what will you give me to insure your return? My word as President. Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a Bethusian Mega Donkey. Okay, then I'll get you that. I need a hostage, something you hold dear. Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure? looking terrified. Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile. Very fast scene - two seconds. Zaphod's 2nd Head SCREAMS! Nooo!!! Zaphod unconscious on the operating table. Blood and instruments everywhere. Zaphod's head hangs on the wall. Wires feed out of the neck into a huge machine. Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's Head 2 -- which is shouting... IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU You should quit while you're "a head" Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the Magrathean defence system alive. Humma laughs maniacally. Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders, staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot. Are we sure this is the right way? Yes!   I think.   I don't know.   Maybe not. Yes, thank you for clearing that up. Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream... Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I want to have your baby!, etc... Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he was given, dons a presidential smile and waves. Back to the ship. Quickly. They quicken their pace when suddenly... Mr. President! We are here for your protection! Zaphod, Ford, Trillian and Arthur freeze in their tracks. Kwaltz and Questular watch the action on the front screen. Fire upon the kidnapper! The police fire.      F, T, & A run for it, but Z stays put. Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's what they want-- He pulls out his gun up and fires back. Hey! Let's do lunch! Nice haircut, fella! Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine-- We should get them together some time! With each line he fires. Ford grabs him. Shots hit a stack of aerosol cans. They EXPLODE. More mist rises. Commander! The President is the kidnapper! Cease fire! The gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk. Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death. Oh God, I really hate Thursdays. Zaphod, what do we do? Build bridges between the stars! He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon. What? I think that was his campaign slogan. Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea. Alright, follow me. She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers the madness of the moment. There they are! moves down the street. The crowd GASPS. The quartet continues anxiously forward, eyeing the police whose guns track their every move. Back off or I'll kill him, I swear I will! Could that actually kill him? forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived. Mr. President, Mr. President!... Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to go sign a few autographs. I totally voted for you! Thank you! Reveal that the female fans are actually a multi-headed, two legged GROUPIE. Get her! surrounding Trillian and edging Ford and Arthur away. Resistance is useless! Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur reaches for Trillian but she is engulfed by Vogons who move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist. Tricia! Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship. This way!  NO!!   TRICIA!!! Arthur up the ramp. Questular and Kwaltz watch the monitor as Vogon Police usher Trillian, in futuristic hand-cuffs, past the Vogon Captain who stands in the foreground on his ship. Bring her to Vogsphere for processing, Captain. The captain nods.      The screen goes black. They're coming here!? But they've only accomplished half the mission. What about Zaphod? HE MUST FACE JUSTICE!! My instructions were clear... From a slot in his chair, he pulls his instructions -- signed in triplicate of course. He reads... "Apprehend the kidnapper, rescue the president." We do them in that order. And until the kidnapper is properly processed, she isn't officially apprehended, now is she, Mr. Vice- President? Questular pulls out another small clump of hair. Ford and Arthur drag Zaphod into the bridge. On the front screen, they can see the Vogon ships flying away. We have to go!     Let's GO!  Right! Looking strangely happy, he slides the PINK COORDINATE Computer! Take us to Magrathea! What? No! Follow those ships!  Arthur lunges for a control. Zaphod woozily tries to stop him. There's a struggle, then Zaphod realizes... Hey -- my third arm.   I had one, didn't I? We have to go after her! The computer fires to life, BLEEPS and BLIPS. Only now it has an effete, effeminate, almost matriarchal voice. Boys, please! Not so rough. You're damaging my joystick. They all look at the source of the voice, confused. Who is that? Ghastly, isn't it? I was asked to change the personality type, this was the emergency back-up. How, if you want me to take you somewhere, we're going to have to start using our magic words, "please" and "thank you." Can you change it back? I can -- but I won't enjoy it. I'm wait-ing... Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to sleep instead -- with a contented smile. Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him. Ford? Marvin? Don't look at me.   I'm too depressed.   Computer?! Isn't there some kind of manual override switch thing? Yeeessss... Magic words? Show me the override switch or I'll reprogram you with a very large axe.  I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at. ILLUMINATES. "MANUAL OVERRIDE." Arthur flips the switch. The cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards. The cockpit bubble POPS out like an ejector seat, now a little glass pod. It floats through space, then rear thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward. An aircraft steering wheel rises up between Arthur's legs. He grabs it, spinning out of control. I think I should push this button. Ford pushes a big button.    AN ALARM SOUNDS! What's that? What happened?! A sign lit up saying "Please do not push this button again." Arthur grabs the control, does his best to steer. The glass pod streaks unsteadily forward toward A DULL The rectangular ship sits on the surface as Police escort Trillian off it and into a GRAY RECTANGULAR BLDG. The ground is barren. A scintillatingly jeweled crab crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. We hear the sound of the pod approaching  as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground, steam rising. The door opens. The three emerge. Wow... I know.    Dreadful, isn't it? Sorry about the landing.    Where are we? Magrathea! Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is Vogsphere. No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it! Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to concentrate. What is it? A Thinking Cap. Zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around. rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see. This will all end in tears, I just know it. Marvin moves out, a few paces behind. I checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't." I'm assuming your plan is better.  Well, I sort of had this idea we could... A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts. Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed. Did anyone see that? See what? They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous. Nothing. They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed. What was it? Nothing. Just my imagination. Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face. Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all. Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch me. Something's happening. They watch.    Arthur walks. And walks. Okay.     I think we... A paddle springs up and smacks Ford's face. AH! He leaps back, clutching his cheeks.      Arthur spins around. You, too? Yes.    What was that? Arthur lifts his feet very carefully. I th... He stops himself and looks round.  What do you think, Zaphod? Zaphod pulls his thinking cap down, thinks hard. I think we should keep going. A paddle shoots up, smacks Zaphod's face.    They all saw. AAAH!! What the blazes is that?  I have... an idea. A paddle shoots up. Ford ducks. It misses. He grabs its telescopic stalk. It thrashes in his hands. He breaks it. Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have ideas or theories -- nothing. A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several paddles shoot up. Smacking them. I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her. I have an idea.  Run! Ever the politician. They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts out of the ground around them, smacking violently. They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building. Okay, so...  ...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas coming...  ...this is by no means an idea that has any merit, but Marvin -- can you give me a hand? The dullest office environment ever. A counter with few  The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them, holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again, trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise. Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit. The Vogons look up, nonplussed. Alright, where is she? Who? The Director of Robot Arm repair? Next building, out the door to the left. Arthur looks at the arm -- then slowly lowers it. Actually, we're looking for...  ...someone you're detaining, perhaps in some form of incarceration... Prisoner Release Department. Six buildings down, out the door, right, left, then two rights. Big gray building, can't miss it. Trillian is seated beside a desk while a VOGON OFFICER asks her questions. Kwaltz and Questular stand nearby. Name? Trillian. He types into his ancient looking computer. Not registered. Try Tricia McMillan. Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of Blaard? No.     Tricia Imogene McMillan of Earth. The Officer types, checks his screen, shakes his head. Sorry.    No record of "Earth."  Earth. In the Milky Way? {remembering) Um...galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. The Vogon Officer types, reads from the screen. Right. Here it is. "Earth. Destroyed." Do you have a second home planet? Destroyed? No -- that's impossible. Says here it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway. The order was given...three weeks ago. He said the gray building, right? 2 VOGON POLICE escorting someone in handcuffs into one of the buildings. There.   That's it.   This way. He raises Marvin's arm, pointing the fingers. A, F & Z enter the double doors, then stop short. Stunned. wait sort of room. Bland. Bad lighting. Numbered windows. It's packed with all manner of species. Leave this to me. I'm British.  I know how to queue. He confidently takes a number and gets in line with the several hundred others -- feeling very much at home. Trillian sits at the Officer's desk, arms folded, defiant. I don't believe you. This is some sort of trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet, especially mine. Kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper. These are the orders. Trillian takes the paper, runs her finger down to the signature line where it reads "Love and kisses, Zaphod!" Love and kisses...? She hands the paper back, swallowing emotion. Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section 34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney." Unless -- said kidnapping is of the President, in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. We thank you for your cooperation. A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box. A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window. The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps. Zaphod is in line with Arthur and Ford.     He looks up to: A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPH -- of himself, in suit and tie, smiling broadly. He lowers his thinking cap. Next! Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps his head low and bowed. Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a prisoner released? Prisoner release form? She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form. Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is nothing but shelves holding forms.  69. Right. Once I've filled it out can I return to the front of the line, seeing as I've already waited... No.     Next! Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod. Can't you do something?!     You're President, aren't you? You want me to make a speech, shake a hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's all a little fuzzy. Arthur angrily fills out the form. Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks the screen. This Prisoner is being detained for...  Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for release at this time. You can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and wait. Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this. Alright, look. sunglasses off Zaphod) This is the President. She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay... He says the whole kidnapping thing was a terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean anything by it and he's ordering you to let her go.  But this isn't a Presidential Release of Prisoner form. Those are blue. She points to the wall of forms. Arthur sighs. Trillian is lowered into the Bugblatter beast box/cage. We cannot see the beast but it's screams of hunger are scaring the hell out of Trillian. ...who returns, practically shoving Zaphod forward. Zaphod hands the Vogon Processor the blue form. Okay... She reviews the form, stamps it, pulls off the carbon copy underneath, hands that to Zaphod. Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby, out the door, right, left, 2nd door on the right. As she braces herself to be eaten by the monster. Suddenly, a couple of VOGON GUARDS enter and hand Kwaltz a blue piece of paper. He reviews it, then signs it. You're free to go.    Release her. The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a cable. The Bugblatter beast goes berserk. What!? reading) He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go get him! But the Guard is already escorting Trillian out of the room. Kwaltz is completing paperwork. Commander? Kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand, one finger raised, silencing Questular while he continues. Questular sighs. We hear the Bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are closed on him. A guard escorts Trillian into the Lobby where F, A & Z await. Arthur steps toward her but Zaphod steps in front of him, smiling, arms outstretched. Trillian walks up to Zaphod -- and SLAPS HIM.  You bastard. You signed the order to destroy Earth?! He did? I did? "Love and kisses, Zaphod?"  I saw the form. You didn't even read it, did you? Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy. I don't get a lot of time for reading. An entire planet, Zaphod. My home. Gone. All because you thought someone wanted your autograph! She SLAPS him again, storms away, bursting out the door. They framed me! It's routine for controlling Presidents! Kwaltz finishes his paperwork, stacks it neatly, holds it up for Questular to see. Cancellation of the Rescue of the President. He hands it to a Messenger who runs off.    Another one runs up. Now. {with menace) Get me the Apprehension of the President form. Trillian storms away from the building, enraged. She sees a one-armed Marvin standing by the glass pod. She heads for him. Arthur catches up to her. Trillian... You knew. Why didn't you tell me?  I tried. He threatened me. Get a backbone, Arthur. She storms ahead of him.     He stops. What about coming here to rescue you?! That was my brilliant idea! A paddle shoots up and slaps him in the face. Kwaltz and Questular, flanked by the Vogon police force, step out of the building just in time to see... They all watch as it disappears from sight. The President tests my patience. This time, I shall pursue him myself. Ready my ship! Yes!   This is more like it. Kwaltz sits in a desk, filling out a form. Questular holds two clumps of hair in each fist. My license is expired, Mr. Vice President. I can't fly with an expired license -- it's against the law. Questular fists tremble.     PLOP.   Out comes two large tufts of hair. The pod is reattached to the Heart of Gold which soars through the stars. They're all getting buckled into their seats.   Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats! Eddie!   Welcome back! The ship suddenly BLASTS forward. Their heads are slammed back into the seats as they VIBRATE VIOLENTLY. WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?!   WHERE DID YOU I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING! Arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding across it, getting thrown across the ship. They continue to vibrate -- even more violently. Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a rollercoaster ride. ISN'T IT GREAT?! ...the H.O.G. is but a blur as it streaks along. Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace. Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma Z8B530. Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and moves away from the console. A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean forward. Okay, that's it...I think. Computer?      Is that...where are we headed again? Magrathea? Hang on, fella, and I'll check.  Arthur turns, look over at... emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek. Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say. Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry. She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak. Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry. Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee. Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.  Take us in. They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash with light. Two suns rise behind the planet.     It's breathtaking. The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm... Marvin  rises in the back, peers out. It's rubbish. shape of a man, appears on the screen before them. Greetings. This is a recorded announcement as we're all out the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted, kindly do so at the tone. BEEP.   Then stunned silence.  Closed? How can a planet be closed? For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay, computer. Keep going. Take us down. Happy to! The ship eases forward. The image appears again. It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated.    As a token of our appreciation, we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft. To ensure on-going quality of service, your death may be monitored for training purposes. Thank you. The image vanishes. A beat.    Then... Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us. Should I take evasive action? Zaphod just smiles. Ford steps up. Um...yes, computer.   Evade! Massive acceleration! An illuminated dome lowers from the ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod. The Heart of Gold streaks away. Two large missiles follow and mimic the H.O.G.'s every move. The crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other. There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems. Impact minus 45 seconds. Call me Eddie if it'll help you relax. The H.O.G. streaks forward. The missiles are gaining. Computer!   DO SOMETHING!!  Sure thing, fellah. Handing over manual control. Good luck! Big swell of Muzak. The ship drops like a stone. Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls. I can't do this without my other arm! straight for us. Did we lose them? No.   They're right behind us. He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON. Look, why don't I just hit this thing? NO! We're here! No telling where it will send us! The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster. They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass lid. NO! Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON. WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing madness! Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS. It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact same place they were - dazed. Um...where are we? Exactly where we were, I think. And the missiles? Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale. He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by. At an improbability factor of eight million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to one against. They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even? He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile. I could really use a cup of tea. The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops rising, starts falling. It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell. The camera moves around the whale as it falls.  Ahhhh!!!! What's happening? Excuse me! Who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? What is this 'I' that I want to know what it is? Calm down, get a grip now ... ooh! This is an interesting sensation... ANGLE: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit. Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite strong now. And hey,what's this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do. Perhaps I can give it a better name later when I've found out what it's for! It must be very important because there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it. Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call it a tail - yeah! Tail! The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight. Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to achieve much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. How. Have I built up a coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, ao much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation ... Or is it the wind? There really is an awful lot of that now, isn't there? It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the whale, abandoning it ... And hey! What's this thing coming suddenly coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if it'll be friends with me? We hear a sickening thud o.s.  Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again." We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING. Many have speculated that if we knew why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now. The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it -- along with a few petunias. They all grimace. aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight. They walk toward it. Arthur walks behind the others, his head down. Hey...this looks familiar. Arthur looks up, registers surprise. The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS" Must be portal doors. You mean -- the hippies were right? In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH." Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone. Trillian and Ford follow. Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob, anything. He must've hit something because the front of the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING Okay.   In we go.  What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind? We can't step into that...that. We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the right one, we come back and pick another. No biggie. Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the last door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies. Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere, covers her ears - trying to block them out It's the right one.   I have a hunch. Ford..? He's got good hunches.   I say we go. Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?! Hey, I think I resent that. I don't care what you think you think... They all start arguing over each other. We focus on Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers her ears -- then screams.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery? They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford is semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed. That's supposed to happen...I think. Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...  Hey, wait for me! He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in. Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut. No.    No!     NOOO!!! He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He collapses and buries his head in his hands. I told you this would all end in tears. Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright beside them. Trillian is already heading down the street toward the Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her. Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion. Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it? Don't talk to me about life. Here I am, God knows how far from home... Don't talk to me about God. ...and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth.  I know. You keep going on about it.      It sounds awful. Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it was... Did it have oceans? Yes.   Great wide rolling blue oceans. Can't bear oceans. Arthur looks up at Marvin. So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot. You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level. Excuse me. Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES. Aah! He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man. Who are you? My name is not important. Arthur continues to scramble away from the man. You must come with me. Terrible events are afoot. You must come or you'll be late. Late? What for? What is your name, Earthman?  Dent. Arthur Dent. Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent." It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been much   good at them myself, but I'm told they   can be terribly effective. He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom." Your friends are safe. You can trust me. Trust a man who won't tell me his name? My name? Very well...  My name is...Slartibartfast. Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow. SLARTIBARTFAST I said it wasn't important. Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin. I could calculate your chances of survival -- but you won't like it. Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side. I must warn you. We are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me. He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you. Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in. Whaa! He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows. Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to... where the fleet of Vogon ships has now arrived. Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse, it suddenly does. Kwaltz sits in his chair as they press forward. The This is a recorded announcement as we're all out at the moment. The Commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for... Turn that off. Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing. I told you you might find it a bit disturbing. I have found this whole day a bit disturbing. Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices... ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets. Did you know we built planets? No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed. Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines was always my favorite. Used to have endless fun doing all the little fiddly bits round fjords. But the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom- built planets are something of a luxury commodity...  At any rate, there's been a terrible mix up with your planet. You must come with me or it's all going to blow up in our faces. The best laid plans of mice, you know... ...and men. Mmmm? What? The best laid plans of mice and men.  I don't think men have got much to do with it. Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door. button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history. The space is millions of miles across. Floating in it are half-finished planets, construction gantries around them. Welcome to our factory floor. Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple. They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it. The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter... Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor. This is it! He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.      They round the corner to find... Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of the TINNY MUSIC. Deep Thought is watching TV.     A violent, stupid cartoon. Deep Thought...! Shhh.   This is a good bit. The cartoon continues. Zaphod enters, removes his thinking cap and reverently approaches. He kneels...  Oh great Deep Thought...we have traveled long...and far. Have you calculated... the Ultimate Question? Of Life, the Universe and Everything? No. No? I've been watching TV. Oh... Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling. I designed another computer to perform that great task. Oh, right...I forgot.  Is it here? Not here. Another world. It's on another world? It is another world. Or was. Where? Ask your companion. Zaphod turns to Ford.     Ford looks confused. Not him. Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused. Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard. 0kay -- you're sure you don't have the Question? Or a way to you, you know -- access it or something. I think I've done like a lot to get here...  Shhhhhh... Zaphod looks up.    Deep Thought is shushing him? The show's back on. A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume. Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed. Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be about. He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm. Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head. I know.    Why did I do that? He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns... Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g... Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A robotic arm pushes it forward. Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away, Ford hands Zaphod the gun. Here.     Take it. I don't do guns. Zaphod takes it with a smile... Thank you. ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has happened. Great!    This is a bust, too!  Hey, man, you must be really frustrated. To go through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no fame and money, and you deserve that, man. Because you're great -- you're just really, really great. Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something. Give me that thing. The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and clouds obscure our view. The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs. Oh, you had that problem, too? In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face. What? You did that? I've been there! The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet. Then I gather you've met some of the inhabitants. The Vogons?  Relentless blighters. each hit a ship. They explode. Two more missiles fire, taking out two more ships. But several ships do land. Marvin watches from within the Stonehenge formation. Life. Loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it. ...and you're right, I shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right? at Zaphod. Shoot him again. Ford reluctantly pulls the trigger.    CLICK. Hitchhiking is good.    Towels are good, too. Brilliant. Yeah.    I kinda like this. She take the gun from him. A gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. Useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh? She starts walking. We should get back. Arthur's waiting. Who cares?  I do -- especially since we're both somewhat of an endangered species now.  Why so edgy? She can't believe he's asking this.     She aims the gun, CLICK! Of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the Galaxy with the guy who signed the order CLICK.   She shoots him again. You actually wanted to know the Question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't. She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK. You've got no home, no family, no one to be with -- and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself. Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes to well with tears. She lowers the gun. Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he realizes what he said and doesn't like it. Give me that thing. He grabs the gun, points it at her. Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman. Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM. They turn, shielding their eyes. Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a couple of... FLASH! KEEEOOOW!    They are engulfed in WHITE LIGHT. The transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet. Here we are, then. Look familiar? Arthur turns and looks. There before him is... So -- it wasn't destroyed? Actually, it was. This is a back-up. Earth Mark II. So you're saying you ... made the Earth? Well, not me alone. It was a group effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard of a place, I think it's called Norway? Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey. That was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry to hear about it being blown up. Shocking cock up. The mice were furious. Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice? Are you a fan of plate tectonics? Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down. up noisily. Voila!   Himalayas. Good, eh? Arthur is working very hard to process all this. a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground. Earthman, you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built. Ten minutes later, we would have been free and clear. But we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back-up copy. And they've brought you with them. The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.  They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation? These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program... Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see -- we were experimenting on them. Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings.  Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans. on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it. So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed? That's bureaucracy for you. Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ... That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that. A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside -- partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. Men rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.  I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired, but I always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy than right any day. And are you? No. That's where it all falls down of course.  Here we are, then. stunned to see... intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his house alright. Is this...? Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward the house. Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no photographs or books or any evidence of his existence there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home? Arthur! Arthur pokes his head around a wall to find... table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king. What -- what are you doing? What happened to you? They talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths. Funniest thing.  Our hosts attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase Stun Mist  then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us . Try the mutton. It's fantastic.   Zarking incredible. They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been drugged. Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea? Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip, Closes his eyes, enjoying it. Now that's a cup of tea. We're glad you like it, Earth creature. He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a silver platter. After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea. Arthur stares in shock...can't speak. Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse and Franky mouse . They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension . I'm sorry, I thought you were told about the mice... Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it. He steadies himself on the table. Sit, Earthman. Eat. Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the end slides backward. In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let go of this table. Slartibartfast steps forward.  Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be getting back to work now. That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.  Smarty fart blast? BENJY/FRANKY Eat! Right. It looks like we won't be needing the new Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet. But...they've nearly finished the oceans. That will be all, Slartibartfast. Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight. I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" -- do you mean me? What about her? Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's. We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.  Which explains a lot. She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in. So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it. We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary.  We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here. Sit, Earthling. Sit. Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him. BENJY/FRANKY Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile. This chair is much more -- comfortable. Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit. Drink. He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip. Mmmm.    This really is delicious. Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to business. Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors. FORD/ZAPHOD To business! Benjy and Franky fire them a look. Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a toast. BENJY/FRANKY EAT! Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill. About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.  But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question. Or at least, one that sounds ultimate. Yes.     Got to sound good. An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show. And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea? Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. Did he hear them right? I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain? Yes.     To extract the question. You can't have my brain. I'm using it. Barely. We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe. A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference? I would! No, you wouldn't. We could program you not to. Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles. Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!!  They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it. What are they-- what's in the food?! The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it. Don't worry. You won't feel a thing. The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur. Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away. Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain. Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING MINUTE!! The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop eating and listen. You want the question that goes with the answer "42" How about "What's six times seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one, "How many roads must a man walk down?" Hey, that's not bad. Through the opposite window bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons arriving. Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...? He shakes his head. We don't want to be happy.   We want to be rich. Take his brain.  Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to their feet. Shoot him!! They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy. Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up. Oh, shit. Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat. The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze, Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut. Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick. Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down the hill toward the house. He leans over the table, bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND. An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them...  I must warn you, I'm feeling very depressed. Mr. President!     We are here for your protection! Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially. Thank you! barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead? head emitting smoke.  Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will. We need that gun.  We need tighter gun control! We need his other head.  Okay -- I'll create a distraction. He holds up his towel.  Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.  You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying. More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards... towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass. AHHHHHHHH!!!! The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away. Now! I thought I was...what are       I thought I was...I'll get you... get back... okay          it... you already... fine, fine...                          fine They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes... It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!!     GET HIM!! The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.  The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks forward, sees Marvin raising the gun. Duck! Where? He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as... Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.  Oh what's the point? They turn their weapons on themselves and... their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up. including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing. He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his head. He drops to his knees. Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me. Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular.       He rises -- and paints on a big smile. What am I so pissed off about? I'm great? I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc. Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his clothes and jumps in. Marvin.    You saved our lives. I know.    Wretched, isn't it?  Oh man! I love being me!! They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast. Thank you.  I've just been informed by some of the lads that since we're so near completion, we're going to go ahead and finish Earth. We can put it back exactly the way it was when you left, you know -- unless there's anything you'd like to change. Something you think your planet could do without? Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods... Yes.   Me. He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.    Really? She smiles. Let's go somewhere. Yes, You name it. I'll go. I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused. And I'm hungry. After we get your head let's grab a bite. I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe. As they walk away, we CUT TO... Okay. Hold tight. Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go. Stand-by for commencement of life cycle. All systems checked and cleared. Commencing. We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of music . Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear. The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.
