Written by William Fetters & Jenny Lumet Revised April 16th, 2009 2. 3.  Hello? Yeah...  Of course. I'm on my way. I know...I know...I know...I know. 4. Gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it... ...I tend to agree with the first part.  Hello, your majesty. How are you? I'm fine... you look good... 5. Thanks for organizing everybody. You smell like Listerine and beer.  You couldn't wear a tie? Could have. 6. ...This is nice... I think it's nice that we still do this...  Mom. I forgot. I'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this.  Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait? Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait? Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait?  You two. I quit. ...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler. 7. Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history. She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious. I would be the youngest one, ever, practically... Tyler, would you please pass the butter? Caroline was speaking.  Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this? Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed? I'm okay.  I didn't mean to change the subject. What was the subject? 8. Excuse me? The subject we were discussing. What was it? Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler No. It's the perfect time.  Do you need me to take you anywhere? I'll stay with mom. Then I'll see you after school. Kay. 9. Eat something. Yes, ma'am. I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush. You sold my who? ...What? That voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning... I sold her a toothbrush. Got three bucks. ...Congratulations? Are in order, yes. Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "The S.L.U.T." I was unaware we had a previous business venture. 10. 11. A TINTED TOWN CAR stops in-front of a funky corner brownstone where Caroline waits in a plaid jumper on the front steps. Caroline in the cavernous backseat alone. Her pink knapsack her only company. The Town Car stops at a crosswalk for a GROUP OF CHILDREN in jeans and tee- shirts on their way to a local Public School. Caroline sees them through the tinted glass. They couldn't see her even if they wanted to. It's an unfortunate reality but a reality nonetheless ... the few students paying attention. ...in the wake of terrorist attacks these insurance company actuaries are provided a unique opportunity to raise premiums and profits to protect against events that will likely never occur again... One girl, a focused brunette with beautiful eyes, takes notes relentlessly. She is present, absorbing the material. She raises her hand. Isn't that also an ethical question? Tyler shoots her a glance. He takes in her lovely face, her casual dress, and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf clovers. WE REALIZE this is Alicia "Ally" Craig, now 19. Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope. At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters. 12. Why don't we make this a non- smoking statue?  Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make this a non-smoking statue? You promised you'd quit... I know. You're gonna get emphysema and then you're gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere... You think that would be the worst part about having emphysema? Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the bathroom. Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna...like, listen to me? Dad loves you. So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them. 13. You've got that right. Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a "yule tide homicide." That's because Aunt Sara drinks... You don't drink, right? Duh. So why would anyone wanna avoid you? Caroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes. Michael used to drink. Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21. A shared smile. You're 21. Tyler's smile fades. Tyler on a rolling ladder, shuffling books around. Aidan on the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the middle, at the same time. What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think? I think I'd rather be sodomized. 14. Hey, it's your day. What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like... AIDAN/TYLER "Eight Miles of Books!" I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together... No shit? And ended up dead or in prison. This is why chicks dig you. Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me. Eh. Hey! Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here.  15. I can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man. I'm ready to set up an intervention. A silent moment passes. You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking? One drink. Come out for one drink. When's the last time you had one drink? A hip venue on Greenwich Street. Deejay. Music pumping. Aidan and Tyler make their way through the crowd to a congested bar where the CUTE BARTENDER is swamped. Hey, Megan! She ignores him. You look great! Can I get two Heinekens? Do. Not. Speak. Tyler snorts with laughter.  Is she mad at me or something? No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you. Oh. Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder. Excuse me? 16. Aidan flashes a winning smile. Well, hello... Could you take a picture for us? She holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles. My pleasure... The girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around. Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF. He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman. Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan. Thanks. You've met my roommate... I hope you die. Tyler laughs his ass off. She's all over you. Cheers. They clink bottles. Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a fine time. I love this street. I love this city. Where are you guys from, again? AIDAN'S GIRL Miami. Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New York is it, man. God broke the mold when he made this city. 17. You ever actually been to any of those places? What's your point? AIDAN'S GIRL What are we doing? I'm freezing. Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me. Michael...Mi-i-chael! AIDAN'S GIRL  Asshole. AIDAN'S GIRL Are you coming? TYLER'S GIRL  Hold on, Lauren. 18. MUSICIAN#2 What's your problem? My problem? Keep your hands off my car, asshole. MUSICIAN#2 Blow it out your ass, Guido. MUSICIAN#1 Go back to Long Island. I'm from Queens, faggot TYLER'S GIRL So we were thinking we could go...  God damn it. 19. Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself. A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl. She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy. An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site. first met him at the train station, is standing with the Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn. Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction. Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger, is on the radio to Dispatch. Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan... Cut those two loose. Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.  Take a walk. Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl and... Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1. Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein? Craig finds a packet, or a vial. Nice. You like to get high and hit women? 20. NEANDERTHAL#1 I don't even know the bitch. How about you two? MUSICIAN#1 It wasn't us, man! NEANDERTHAL#1 That cocksucker kicked my car! Shut up, genius. MUSICIAN#1  Eat shit, pencil dick. Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown. It wasn't them.  Tyler...  Take a walk, I said. Hey! 21. They didn't do anything. They didn't start this. Those assholes did. Why do these guys have to go downtown? What are you still doing here? This is bullshit. It was those gorillas who started this. Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you think I give a shit? You're a police officer. You're supposed to. It's a great relief to me, Mr. Roth, to know that you're on top of the situation. Now go the fuck home. How about you do your job? 22. Who knows what time it is. A lovely ASSORTMENT OF PERPETRATORS, Tyler and the musicians are in lockup. Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the holding cell, looking quite relaxed. The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the perch. The ESCORTING OFFICER shouts across the din to Tyler. You can have your call now. I'm good. The door slides shut behind Aidan. You're good? Thank God you're good. Beat. What are you trying to do? What did you want from that cop guy? That was a messed up situation. Those guys... He cups his hands to make a megaphone... ...Are pussies! From Off Screen a chorus of: NEANDERTHAL#1 O/S Faggot! NEANDERTHAL#2 O/S Candy-ass faggot! NEANDERTHAL#3 O/S Fag! There was no justice in that situation. No justice. Okay, Green Hornet ... Lantern ... Asshole.  23. You may not be actually matriculating in school, you may be having a nice time by yourself lurking in the stacks of your book store, but I actually plan on graduating, and having a career and a wife and a girlfriend and a divorce and a mid-life stalking episode and erectile dysfunction, and I will thank you to keep your complexes and nihilistic bullshit... Did you just say "nihilistic"? Yeah. I got it off a cereal box. Tyler smiles. The Escorting Officer returns with a white male LAWYER wearing a two thousand dollar suit. Roth, Brewer. Tyler glares at Aidan. Yeah, I called your dad's office. Sue me. Ally, with a cup of coffee, is on the house phone. So when would that be available?...No, that's sooner than I'd thought. And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay. Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink. I'll call you back. Thanks. Ally hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water. 24. On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug. She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee. What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight? The toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear. Breathe. Did you? I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that? The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember? Beat. Sure. Ally grabs her sweatshirt. Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me. I'll drive you. She flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and the English Muffin. Craig dries his hands, grabs his jacket and a set of keys from the counter. Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of red-brick row houses. Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag. 25. Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys across the roof. She drops them in her bag. Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it. Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car. She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup. You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench. They start to back out. This drive is too long. Tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area. English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Draws the ire of... You know you can't smoke in here. Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him. It's clearly never been used. So what's with the ash tray? It completes the room. Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the pristine surface. He smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman. Tease. Tyler... 26. JANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway. He's ready for you. Tyler follows Janine down the corridor. She looks him up and down, doesn't like what she sees. You're too skinny. And you smell like french fries and cigarettes. Nice to see you too. You want me to lie? Tyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie. Janine scrolls through a Palm Pilot as she walks. They approach the double doors to Charles' office. Try not to give him a heart attack. Okay. Tyler bangs through the doors. Janine grimaces. A row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds. Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen computer, but no personal effects anywhere. Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles' face. Tyler stands. I came to see how much it costs, because I'm giving you the money back. How much what costs? 27. That lawyer. Beat. Ah. That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour. In spite of himself... Christ. Tell me about it. I wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you. I understand. You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail I don't want to be bailed out of anything. Charles looks at his son. I'll get an invoice from Janine. Tyler leaves, slamming the door behind him. Tyler stops, catching himself, realizing the emptiness of the gesture. He looks up and sees Janine looking at him. Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him, loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the manic rhythm of his foot. 28. It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker. Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on a fire hydrant.  Hey. He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a group swoon. He takes Caroline by the elbow... Excuse us, we're due in surgery. He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth Avenue. What happened to your face? Horrible threshing accident. You're so retarded. Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something. He hands her the book of Myths. This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing. Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles. 29. Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom? Guggenheim. What's up with those girls? I just...they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out. When you're drawing? Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature. Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the school. Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature." Caroline smirks. Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature". Sacre Bleu. French Toast. What are you going to tell mom about your face? I finally found something I'm good at? Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual. 30. ...I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus. Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the stairs, right past Aidan.  I mean... uh... life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it. And I'm -- ah, screw it. Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps. Tyler, again with the guitar. Aidan enters, excited. He's got a daughter. Who? The cop... The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge! Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her? You introduce yourself...go on a few dates...be your charming, gentlemanly self... And then, flip the script. What does that mean? 31. Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy. Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay. Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page. I don't know. Be creative. You should be incarcerated on general principle. Hey. What happened to you was very emasculating. Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and I'll drop it. I don't want to get that asshole. Just meet her. I don't want to meet her. She's cute. I don't care. You're meeting her. I'm not meeting her. A Student Hangout. The place is bustling. Numerous NYU stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic. This is one of those moments I'm already regretting. She was here yesterday. 32. What am I supposed to say to this girl? "Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?" Well don't call her doll face. There. The brunette. I know her. I mean, I don't know her, but, I've seen her. She's in my global politics class. There you go! Something to open with. Now get over there. Shazam! Excuse me? My name's Tyler Roth. I was wondering if I could bother you for a minute? You're already bothering me. Um, I'm doing kind of a sociological experiment...I was hoping you could help me out. 33. What are you, kidding me? No, I... may I ask your name? Anonymous. It's Greek. It means "you don't have a shot". Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction? Subtle. I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him. Ah. He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think? Who else do you plan on asking? 34. No one here. The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties. I'm nineteen. In their late teens.  Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and I've run out of those big foam fingers, so I was thinking maybe I could take you out some night? She looks at him. Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation. I don't date sociology majors... they're a rowdy bunch. Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm undecided. About what? Everything. Tyler smiles. Ally tries to hide a smile. She closes her book and extends her hand. I'm Ally. Caroline in art class amongst a sea of green plaid. The girls work in relative silence, drawing, painting. 35. shoulders, sees a lot of amateur art work, then she comes upon Caroline and stops. The teacher finds herself captivated by ... A COMIC PORTRAIT of Diane and Les kissing in the doorway of their brownstone. Diane has a bit of a manic smile and Les is half her size. Caroline notices her teacher staring. She doesn't like it and shifts to block her view. The teacher gently eases her back. Smiles softly. Caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room. Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when... The BITCHY GIRLS we've seen before start whispering and smirking. One of them mouths... Kiss ass freak. Caroline's smile shrinks away and she goes back to work. Ally in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading. Craig yells from the bottom of the stairs. He carries a bag from a video store. Don't be mad... Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry. I do not. It's embarrassing. Her cell phone rings. Hello? 36. Hey. It's Tyler. INTERCUT: Ally winces. Hi. You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated. No... I...I was just... You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V. No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just...getting dressed. She wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with chocolate. And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again? Eight. Right...yes. Eight...okay. She hangs up. Shit. She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the bathroom. Ally comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings. 37. Craig looks at Ally, confused. I'm going out. I can see that. Well, you're a trained investigator. She is moving quickly, grabbing her bag, her wallet. Craig tosses her keys. Who are you going with? A boy from school. Beat. Okay. I wasn't asking for permission.  I know.  Have a good time. Here's cab fare. He peels off a couple of twenties. Thanks. Should I wait up? Dad. Craig puts his hands in the air in surrender. A hole in the wall Lower East Side Thai restaurant. Tyler and Ally sit together perusing menus. A WAITER approaches. 38.  What desserts do you have? Dessert special fried bananas a la mode. Great, I'll have that. A glass of skim milk. Then the mussels, please. Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks. I have my dessert first. Is this a political statement? A medical condition? I just don't see the point in waiting for something I know I want and am going to have. What if I die eating my mussels? Is that probable? It's possible. If an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, I'd die without having eaten the thing I wanted most. But the odds are, I mean... Fine. I'll tell you what, you guarantee me. Swear to me on your eternal soul that I'll make it through my entrée. And I'll wait. 39. Before you answer, keep in mind, if I die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence. My last wish. Are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point? Tyler thinks about it. Smiles. Don't worry. I'll share. Tyler and Ally exit out onto the street. Tyler immediately takes out his cigarettes, his lighter, then he notices... Ally looking at him disappointed. Really? Tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away. A beat. I had a nice time. You had a nice time or you're having a nice time? Ally considers. Because if you're having one, why rush to end it? 35 They approach a CARNIVAL GAME, one those ubiquitous basketball tosses. THE ATTENDANT badgers passersby to test their luck. GIANT STUFFED ANIMALS hang all around it. Tyler pays the Attendant, gets the basketballs. Tosses one, two, the third, then nothing. Game over. Did I tell you I'm Caucasian? 40. Apparently. Tyler pays again, wipes out again. Game over. Tyler pays again. Loses again. He's visibly frustrated now. Can't we just stroll while I feed you ice cream with fireworks in the background? No. If I stop, he wins. Who, the attendant? No, the frigging Giant Panda. Tyler hands the ATTENDANT another dollar. Ally carries a GIANT PANDA under her arm. Tyler walking beside her with a self-satisfied smile. I don't know what you're smiling about. I won. Paying off the attendant is not winning... It's cheating. I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great. Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye? Tyler touches the bandage. Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight. 41. How butch. I know. I'm practically a pirate. Okay, Captain Morgan...  You've got some serious timing. It's getting late. I'll walk you to the train. I'll take a cab. Tyler is just hailing her a taxi. He stands there holding the door open. Thanks. Beat. Tyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away. Not tonight. Not never... just... not tonight. We goin' or what? Hey! Turn on the meter. Tyler respectfully leans back. So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no. 42. Ally considers. She gives him a quick but tender kiss. You're really weird. She gets in the cab.  I'm going to Queens and I don't wanna hear about it. Off she goes in the taxi. Tyler watches her go. Caroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting on his perch, catches it, walks up to her. Happy end of sixth grade! Finally. them. She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle. Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning next to him. They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt... I heard. It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness. Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be. Caroline allows herself a tiny grin. 43. There's, like, a thing... A thing?  A show where you show what you've done and stuff. Will you come? Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before. You're so retarded. Mom's been hyperventilating with joy. Good. I'm sure Les was... TYLER/CAROLINE "Really supportive"! Your school's over, right? Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les get the beach house again? Yup. What are we going to do for your birthday? Nothing. Can we have a party? No. A little one? At Mom's? With Aidan. I'll make Mom behave. No crying. Like that's possible. 44. Caroline smiles. Ally explores Tyler's living room with a tumbler of wine. It's in a state of medium disarray. He clocks her looking. I know. But we have coasters. I don't do coasters till the third date. She looks over his posters, pictures, etc. Tyler scans a stack of CDs, he selects Radiohead's KID A, puts it in. The hypnotic first track fills the room. Ally comes across a FRAMED PHOTO of a band on stage. The lead guitarist looks like Tyler with long hair. Is that you? That's Michael. My brother. He looks like you... or you look like him. Does he play around here? Not any more. Ally notices the old guitar in the corner. Do you play? It depends who you ask. If I asked anybody? They'd say no. I try but it turns out you need talent. So what talents do you actually have? 45. Falconry. I come from a long line of falconers. There's a lot of money in that. Tyler smiles. He's actually a hair nervous. Well there is one thing... Tyler walks to the kitchen counter where a cleaned and polished COVERED CAKE STAND sits. What's that? Our appetizer. Tyler lifts off the cover to reveal a GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE. He's written a message in the icing: "In Case Of Ast-- and then a piece has been crudely cut out. Ally's surprised. It used to say "In Case Of Asteroid" but I took a shower and Aidan got high. Ally and Tyler stand in front of a sink full of dirty dishes, up to their elbows in soapy water. So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein? I don't actually get grades. Beat. I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing. Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice. 46. I like the books. You don't have to help me, you know. At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when. This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?  You make it sound so cheap. It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times. I'm sorry. I didn't... You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job? This. No, that usually never happens. 47. She calmly goes back to washing dishes. Beat. Spaghetti guy stares at her. She gives it right back to him, 100% New York City. Beat. In one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder. She grunts, unglamorously. Tyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on the shower. She has his drivers licence. Apologize. Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell. Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him. Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for the shower head. Apologize. I'd rather eat monkeys. This cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head, giggling. They lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged. Ally spritzes him in the face. I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless. 48. He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally follows. Victory at all costs. Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water. Now... I'm furious. He tosses them in a waste basket. You should quit anyway. Really? Why? Are cigarettes like bad for you or something? Ally playfully slaps him. She notices the tip of Tyler's Is that a tattoo? Let me see. It's not really... Please. It's very bad ass. All that ritualistic scarring. Tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as Ally offers polite applause. Michael's name becomes clear. Ally takes a long look. She sees Tyler's not smiling anymore. She gets it. I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't realize. She looks at him. Asking with out asking. He killed himself. Beat. 49. When? When he was 21. He had just started working for my father. I thought he was a musician. He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy. Mine too. Damn, you're not naked. You're not Irish. T, What happened in the kitchen? It looks like somebody's water broke.  Hi. Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally. Don't feel bad that you're more attracted to me than you are to him it happens to all of them. Oh! You're the assaholic! 50. Well, I--  Wait. What? Tyler and Ally laugh. Aidan's too drunk to care. Alright, you two. Up. Dressed. Let's go. "Around The World" party on the third floor... a lot of ugly but a lot more alcohol. Let's go. I can't, I would, I'd love to, but I've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up. Ally. Ally. Listen to me, young lady. One drink. From any country. I'll even put France on the table. One drink. Your choice. And we're gone.  One drink?  One drink?  One drink. Ally VOMITS in their toilet. Tyler holds her hair back. Aidan appears in the doorway still wearing that flag. Hey, how we doin'? Ally tries to speak, all we hear is a series of groans. Then she dry heaves again. Tyler shoots Aidan a look. What? What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry? You want me to say I"m sorry?  51. You want me to apologize for showing a nice girl a good time? Is that it? Tyler just looks at him. Aidan considers. I'm sorry. Tyler... Tyler kneels down. Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks like she's about to pass out. I, need, you... to call... my dad. Tyler and Aidan share a look. Aidan shrugs. Oh. OK. Sure. Tyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead. Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him... Tyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor. He tries to gently nudge her awake. Ally? Ally? I know Ally's a good kid, Leo. The bedside clock reads 3:47. Craig is on the phone while searching through Ally's desk drawers. For anything. He finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it. ...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo! Craig hangs up the phone. 52. Beat. He picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping through the notebook. Ally wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused, trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock. And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed. ...oh God oh God oh God oh God... Tyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a blanket. Ally comes in pulling on her shoes. Tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door. Craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. Ally enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee. ...I'm sorry. I fell asleep... Craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the Bear. Not looking at her. Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone. You turned your phone off. I forgot to charge it. It dawns on her... That's mine. From my desk. Craig says nothing. Just stirs his coffee. Ally is furious. How could you? 53. You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information. How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect? Then stop acting like one. What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid... You watch your mouth! You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life. My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it. Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date! I smell alcohol... So do I. Dad... 54. CRACK! He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets. Ally! His face is contorted with panic and shame. Ally's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A knot is starting to form where she hit her head. She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is. Beat. Craig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She scrambles up the stairs. Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway, a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach chair, trying again with the guitar. ...So? She just left? No good bye? Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan finishes up a set. Maybe she heard you play the guitar. You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her. Aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of weight on the bar. There are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend. I've dealt with mine and I've forgiven myself... you should do the same. 55. Aidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains. ...little help, T... little help, little help, lotta help... TYLER?! Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing his chest. What the hell was that? Penance. I have to get to work. Tyler and Aidan come into their apartment, Aidan still rubbing his chest. Ally is standing there in the middle of the living area. A packed bag at her feet, her face a mess. I didn't know where else to go. Aidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a protein shake out of a blender. Tyler comes out of his bedroom gently closing the door behind him. How's she doin'? She's pretty shaken up. Tyler takes a seat beside him. Takes out a cigarette. We've really got to fix that dead bolt. My bad. Sorry. Don't be. You think she'll sleep? 56. You realize if she had had the S.L.U.T If looks could kill... Too soon? A silent moment passes. I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that? As long as she needs. Tyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed. Ally appears from the bedroom, framed by the open door. She has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts. You're up. Beat. Can I get you anything? She nods. I'll be out here if you need me. Beat. Ally takes off the shirt and lets it fall. She stands there. We interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making. 57. In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping, a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition. Then again. Young, hungry, aggressive. They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place. Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again. The sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her, he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten. Tyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal. A NOTE propped up next to the bed: "Please don't leave. I'll be back." Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop. The place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go. He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him. Janine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles. She picks up her coffees and approaches him. I can't believe you still come down here. Tyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees. It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk? 58.  Old habits. You're not writing anything bad about me, are you? Not today. I gotta run. Early meetings. Janine turns to go, remembers something, turns back. I probably won't see you before Saturday so...happy birthday. Tyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes. I'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello. Tyler nods sheepishly. Tyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic croak... Bialy. Tyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal. Ally lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little. Hey... Hey... Tyler sits. She shifts and curls next to him. Where did you go? Downtown. 59. Why? There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy. New York is full of coffee shops. This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him. Oh. So you go there to write? To him? Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you. My mom was murdered eight years ago. The same year your brother died. You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know? It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy.  60. I don't want you to think that because I'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...I don't know, it's just recently, he seems really... She looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient. Ally tears up. Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something. Tyler strokes her hair. I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself. She is weeping. Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can. Holding her and kissing her hair. Sergeant Craig standing with a ROOKIE OFFICER, berating. Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork? No, sir. Craig is working up a head of steam. Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork. But paperwork keeps our ship afloat. Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags. But I can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing... Leo interrupts. Jim... 61. Craig snaps his head around. ...What? Leo gestures to speak privately. Ally called Sharon. What? She said to tell you, she's with friends, and she's fine. What friends? She didn't say. That's all? His partner nods. Craig looks away. I'm sorry, Jim. Listen, why don't you come over this weekend? We'll get the grill going. Sharon wants to see you. We can have some people, nice people...You can circulate a little... No. Jim... Leo, no. Stop. Craig goes back to his desk. Leo looks after him. Aidan sits in the living room, trying to assemble an IKEA television stand. A joint smolders in the ashtray. The BUZZER rings. 62. Hello? Aidan, it's Diane. Oh, hey Diane. T! It's your mom. Hey Diane. You really have to fix that door. I'm so sorry to just show up. I called but your phone was busy. No problem. Come on in. Hey mom. Hey. I'm so sorry honey. I tried to call but... TYLER. It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally, this is my mom, Diane. Hi. Nice to meet you. 63. Ally. It's lovely to met you. Just lovely. Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something? Yes. Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please? Uh..okay. Thank you. How's work, Diane? Well ...  I just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks. So that's good. On the other hand, I have six other families. But Tyler, I wanted to talk to you. Come on, Aidan. What? Nice to meet you, Diane. 64. Don't freaking bogart that joint, Diane. Sorry. Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me. I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers? Of course. Tyler, Your father is driving me crazy. I shouldn't even be discussing this with you. I can't get him to say he'll come to your sister's exhibit. Her art exhibit. He says he's in the middle of an IPO. Les says I shouldn't broker. I should let them be on whatever road they're on. I'll get him there. She cares about this, even though she's pretending she doesn't. I'll get him there, mom. You will? 65. Yes. She looks relieved. Thank you. Thank you. She kisses his cheek, and rises to go. He takes her to the door. Why don't you bring that lovely girl to your birthday?  Diane... Sorry. Sorry. I love you, darling, but this place reeks of marijuana. She goes, shutting the door behind her. Aidan and Ally on the roof, they've arranged themselves in the deck chairs. That was weird. I assume most moms don't smoke weed in front of their son's...um Piece of ass? You know, you're a poet. Hey. I know one thing. I know that in the time I've lived with Tyler, he has never introduced a girl ... woman...female...to his mom before. It's not like he had a choice. She ambushed us. 66. Yeah, but he would've shoved you in a closet or something. Or literally pretended you were a hallucination. Ha ha. I mean it. It's the first time. Ever. Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird? No. Ally throws up her hands. Tyler, having pulled the decrepit house phone into the bathroom, is leaning against the sink, girding himself to call Charles. He looks in the mirror and makes a face. Janine pokes her head into Charles' office. Charles is swamped with work and surrounded by UNDERLINGS. Charles, it's your son. Charles is surprised. What? On the phone. Okay. He punches a button. Tyler, you're on speakerphone. 67. It's about Caroline's show. Are you planning on attending? What? There are people here. You'll have to speak up. Tyler holds the phone away from his face and screams at it, silently. Caroline's show. What about it?  You are coming, right? Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to dinner first. Alright?...  Janine? Dinner? That's not... I'll make a reservation and have Janine call you. He hangs up. Tyler stares at the phone a sec, then hits his head, once, against the bathroom door. Tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally standing behind him with her hands over his eyes. Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn  the characters from the ALICE statue in frosting. It reads "A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU", and has "22" in numerical candles and "+ 1 TO UNGROW ON" written next to that. 68. She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing. There's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les. Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song. Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's efforts. He takes a huge breath... Make a wish. He looks at her and blows out the candles. Everybody applauds, Diane longer than anyone else. Her eyes are shining. The cake totally devoured. Les is obsessively eating frosting. Caroline is trying to teach Aidan how to waltz in the living room. He is... Retarded. Tyler? Tyler rises from the sofa and takes over as Caroline's partner. She puts her feet on top of his feet and they waltz. TYLER/CAROLINE "One, two. three. One, two, three" Ally and Diane are washing dishes in silence. Beat. You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with. Beat. He was doing it to impress you. He's never washed a dish in his life. 69. Caroline at her desk, sketching. Her door is ajar. Ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection of artwork on the walls. Wow. Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering of a fleeting moment. May I? Caroline shrugs. Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder. That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert. Caroline smiles. I can't believe he smokes in front of you. Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable. Ally smiles. Caroline goes back to work. Ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls. It stirs a memory. You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite. Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world. So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up. 70.  You wanna come? Was it that obvious? But only if you're OK with it. I don't want to impose and I'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there. Caroline considers this. You're not random... you're Tyler's girlfriend. Ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly. She seems a bit perplexed, then grins. It's okay with her. Tyler wearing the suit we met him in, it's been dry-cleaned. Ally emerges from the bathroom, looking gorgeous in a vintage black cocktail dress and carrying a pink wrap. You like? Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages. You just want to skip dinner. I got you a tie. She hands him a simple blue tie that matches his eyes. Beat. I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you. 71. You're learning. Tyler puts on his tie in the mirror. He scowls. Tyler and Ally sip cocktails at the nicest table in the place. There's an empty seat. Tyler's eyes flicker towards the door. Twice. He touches his tie. Have you ever been here? Ally tries to lighten his mood.  Yeah. Every Tuesday with my pop. This goes right past Tyler whose eyes flicker towards the door again. He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister. Tyler finishes his drink, signals a WAITER who glides to the table. I'll have a whiskey. Get me one too... Like a stealth bomber. At least this moment rescued the men from actually having to greet each other. Yes. For the lady? I'm fine, thank you. The waiter goes. This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth. Charles gives a courtly nod and takes her hand. 72. A pleasure. An empty wine bottle. Charles cuts into a one-hundred dollar steak. You're going to be a social worker? Yes. But with an area of focused responsibility. It's easier to find a job that way. What will your area be? Criminal Justice. Tough area. When I was little I wanted to play first base for the Mets. I don't think it's any harder than that. The Mets, huh.  I'm from Rockaway. Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll. It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween. Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were. 73.  Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.  It's a metaphor... Roger Clemens. Shane Spencer. Nick Johnson.  He's big boned! How long has your dad been a cop? Twenty-two years. 74. Would you excuse me please... I'm so sorry. It's OK. Charles gets up from the table. Tyler, not able to help himself, shoots him a glance. Ally clocks it. It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert. Charles returns. I'm sorry...And your mother? She passed away when I was eleven. Ah. She was murdered. I was there. Charles and Tyler are stunned to silence.  I never told you that part. Why are you saying this now? I don't know. The men look at her. She's a hero. And, here you are. Yup. Here I am. There is an empty Lean Cuisine box, and two empty Beer Cans on the counter. 75. Craig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1. BEEP. He removes an Eggplant Parmigiana and slides it carefully on to a waiting plate. He takes it, along with a fresh beer, to the living room. He sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote, unpausing ERIN BROCKOVICH. Tyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well. I think he's lovely. Tyler puts his head in his hands. God. Charles returns. His face blank. Don't say it. I have to go to the office. You have somewhere else to be, Dad. Charles adjusts his tie. Tyler loosens his. Ally is unsure where to look. The exhibit runs til nine. You guys take the car. I'll meet you. I don't believe you. That's all there is, Tyler. It's not good enough. I don't have to justify anything to you. Take the car. I'll get a cab. I'll meet you. 76. He steps into the street to hail a cab. Tyler watches his dad get into a taxi, then holds the car door for Ally. Amateur artwork and picked over catering. The rest of the exhibitors are high school age, even a college freshman or two. They mill with their friends and families. Animated. Ally and Aidan stand before a COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR Diane kissing, Tyler on the park bench). Caroline sits on a catering table, Tyler next to her. She looks miserable, he looks furious. Diane bustles over with a plate of cupcakes and a big stupid grin. I brought you every flavor. Caroline looks once at her mom then...  I'm ready to go home now. Tyler nods, takes her hand. Calls to... Ally...? Les, eating a cupcake, and Ally, stand under a portrait of Charles. Ally picks up her purse. Diane standing there with her cupcakes. Tyler, visibly agitated, is letting Ally in the front door to the apartment. He grabs his bike off the wall. Where are you going? I have something I've got to do. Now? Ally reaches for his elbow. He yanks his arm away. 77. Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what? He slams out. Ally looks like she's been slapped. Charles in a meeting with several SUBORDINATES. Everyone is in late night disarray. They are obviously on their way to pulling an all-nighter. The door to the office flies open. Tyler barges in. Janine trailing. Tyler? Tyler? You can't just... It's fine Janine. There is space between the two men. Tyler extends a rolled up piece of paper to his father. She drew you a picture. Put it on the table. Beat. Tyler holds on to the portrait. You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her. If I have any questions about what my daughter may believe, I'll let you know. Tyler gestures with the portrait Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life? 78. I've heard this song before, Tyler. SUBORDINATE#1 We can come back... It's fine, Khaleel. Who is this display for? You, Mr. Roth. She knows I will take care of her. And...? SUBORDINATE#1 We really can come back another... Sit the fuck down. And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means. Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it? 79. I have provided her world. And yours. That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt? You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch. Charles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than willing. Janine and one of the Subordinates get between them. Stop! Stop! The men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed. Get out of here Tyler. Tyler runs for the door. Stumbling over furniture, Caroline's portrait crushed under his feet. Ally, still in her dress, trying to excavate an ice tray frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her eyes widen... 80. Oh my God. She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is going to get him through. Okay. She yanks his head up. It's okay. They kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her face. They kiss. He kisses her like he's starved for her. Tyler and Ally, wrapped around each other, both deeply asleep. Craig, home from work. He hits the button on the answering machine. There's just one message.  Dad, it's me. I've been invited...I'm going away to the beach for Labor Day...They're nice people. If there's any problem I'll call. Or they will. Okay...Bye. As he takes off his jacket, Craig hits rewind and plays the message again...  Dad, it's me... Raucous laughter. Caroline, Tyler, Les, Ally and Aidan are in the living room playing charades. 81.  I genuinely have no idea...are you having a seizure? Time. Berlin Alexanderplatz! You people are culturally bankrupt. Whose was that anyway? Mine. Okay, you. Bed. LES. Me? Yeah, baby. Gross. Gross. Gross me out the door. You're just the prettiest girl. Holy crap. What's with all the smiling? 82. Caroline travels through the living room with a popsicle. She is headed for her bedroom. A child could do Berlin Alexanderplatz, you spaz. Les snorts with laughter. Diane rises, dumping him to the floor. Hey! I want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides I'm ruining her life. On her way out, Diane pauses and gently pushes one of Ally's stray curls behind her ear. Smiles down at her. Aren't you a treasure. Ally stares up at Diane for a beat, her eyes shining. Tanned and rejuvenated, Ally, Tyler, and Aidan sit together on the train back to the city. Ally and Tyler kiss. Aidan watches them. I want a girlfriend. What? Dinners out, movies. Regular sex. That could be all right. For like, a summer. You're such a romantic. And I've had all the races. Excuse me? 83. I've had all the races. I've been with girls from every...race. That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room. White girl. Please. Like falling off a log. As a matter of fact... Shut up. Black girl. But of course. Asian. Twice. Latina. Oui! A Latin girl actually slept with you? What's her name? She's out of the club. Eskimo. TYLER/ALLY No way! Monica Ipellie. She works at the Public Library on 96th street. 84. You slept with an Eskimo? You went to the library? Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to show your ignorance. I don't believe you. Fine. Nice girl. While we were doing it, I couldn't get this little, like, song out of my head... "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum..." Prove it. Ten bucks. You wanna go to the library? The minute we get off this train. Fine. Tyler, are you coming? I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you. 85. Tyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in his pocket for his keys. He sings the Inuit song to himself... bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum... His front door is unlocked. Tyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the apartment. Craig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall. Craig looks up. The men lock eyes. Craig's eyes go to the bat. Tyler leans it slowly against the wall. Beat. Where is she? What are you doing in my house? Craig's eyes flash. Where's my daughter? She's not here now. She's at the library. Craig's face says it: "Bullshit". Does she know? Cops never ask a question they don't know the answer to. No. 86. I didn't think so. I figured you'd probably leave that up to me when you're done with her. I'm not going anywhere. That's true, Tyler Roth, son of Charles and Diane. Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased, suicide by hanging. You're kinda lost, aren't you? Taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class? I'm the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag. She needs you. 87. He is trying, before our eyes, to pull the shards of himself together. His gun visible at his waistband. Tyler's coughing, his face still red, his eyes travel briefly to the bat, then to Craig. Craig closes his eyes, very briefly, then rises. Not looking at Tyler. Beat. Looking at Tyler. Beat. Craig goes to the front door. Get a fucking dead bolt. Slam. And then he's gone. The door bounces in its frame. And then it's just Tyler trying to remember how to breathe. Tyler smoking, standing at the window, waiting for Ally. He sees her walking up to the front door. He grinds his cigarette out. Ally is running up the stairs Tyler Keats Roth! She arrives at the door. He banged an Inuit! She's really nice. And smart. I don't get it. Beat. What's going on? Your dad was here.  What? When I got home. 88. I hate him! There's more. He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye. I don't understand. I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school. Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you. Ally... I'm going to be sick. Hey. 89. Don't do that. What are you doing? Do you realize what you've done? Yeah. He doesn't. Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way. But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you, No. That's exactly what you meant to do. She pushes past him and out the door. Ally heads down. Aidan heads up. He smiles wide. Hey. Ally pushes past him. Prick. Tyler sitting on the ratty couch. Aidan eats old Chinese food from the container. He offers some to Tyler. They sit in silence. Tyler swelling. Aidan eating. You had to tell her eventually... This is no comfort. 90. Glass half full... you just saved yourself an awkward Thanksgiving. Sincere now. She'll be back, T. Tyler heads into his bedroom and shuts the door. Sergeant Craig working on a sink full of dirty dishes. He scrubs at a filthy pan with a piece of steel wool. He's manic but there's not a beer can in sight. You know you're not supposed to use that on non-stick pans... Craig turns, finds her there in the doorway, bag at her feet. It takes off the teflon. They stare at each other for a moment. You should let it soak. Okay. They look at each other. Craig tries a smile. Ally's cool with him. Moving towards him, past him. I'm going upstairs. Caroline and Diane walk up to the DOORMAN. Caroline carries a gift, a sleeping bag. Diane smiles at her daughter. Stop smiling. You look insane. Diane can't help it try as she might. 91. I'm sorry, honey. I just... it's nice. Like an end of the summer send off. Caroline rolls her eyes. Have fun. Caroline goes into the lobby. Diane heads back to her car. Caroline gives her gift to THE BIRTHDAY GIRL who smiles. She follows her into the next room where the other PARTY GUESTS watch a movie. They all turn and look at Caroline. Caroline smiles sheepishly. Some of the MEAN GIRLS are there, One of them gives her a perfunctory smile. NIGHT. Jackie Chan's foot slamming through a wall. Tyler and Aidan are watching RUSH HOUR 2. Aidan slurps from a super mega sized soda, laughing, enjoying himself. He turns to his friend. Tyler sits, completely drained, looking like the loneliest guy on the planet. Aidan gives him a nudge. Tyler looks at the screen for a sec and half smiles, then slips away again. Aidan is genuinely concerned. The party girl's MOM is in a bathrobe. She looks horrified, she has one hand covering her mouth and is whispering into a cell phone. Caroline is on the kitchen phone. Her long hair has been CUT TO PIECES while she slept. She is crying.  Mom? Ally and her father cook breakfast together. There's a knock. 92. Aidan paces nervously. Craig appears in an apron. Aidan smiles. Hi. Beat. Is this the, uh, that is, does, uh, Alicia Craig. Does she live here? Craig nods. Oh great. I'm... You think I don't remember you? No, sir. Who is it Dad? Ally sees Aidan. She touches her father's forearm. It's OK... Craig steps back into the house. Six inches. Really. He backs into the hall. Aidan and Ally are alone. What do you want? Look, I'm a prick. And... Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.    He's got the mangled Honey Bear. Dad... 93. He goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved. Tyler's not. She starts to close the door. Wait. Shit. This isn't really my thing. He lied to me. He's in love with you. He'd like to think he is. Aidan doesn't get it. I don't know what that means...I've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you. She's a lot shorter and shares his DNA. Ally looks away. You don't have to forgive him today... just forgive him. Craig reappears from the deep. Thanks for stopping by. Father and daughter go back into the house. Aidan exhales. Diane is on the house phone, preparing a tray of tea and cinnamon toast for Caroline as she talks. 94. Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school?...Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap!... She slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and WE on his cell phone.  She's pretty traumatized. I wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone... Caroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed. Her head is nestled on his shoulder. She looks even tinier than usual. Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair. She looks pale, wasted. Her eyes are sunken and she's fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice. Les, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk...  There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property. The school won't do anything. They'll probably get away with it... Tyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page as he hears this. Diane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally. Aidan wraps his arms around Diane and gives her a hug. Ally hangs back a bit, unsure, then embraces Diane. Tyler emerges from the hallway. 95.  She's asleep. He sees Aidan and Ally. Stops short. Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it behind her. Last one ever. I swear. I don't care. Beat. I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here. A silent moment passes. For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie. I'm sorry. Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to just forgive you? A BMW 7 Series speeds around the corner. Stops in front of the house. Charles gets out of the car, sees his son. How is she? She's sleeping. Diane emerges from the house. Charles strides quickly towards her. 96. Caroline asleep in her bed. Charles stands in the doorway watching her sleep, we get the feeling he hasn't seen her asleep in some time. Diane appears at his side. How long do you think she'll sleep? I think she'll be out for a while. Would you like to wait? Thank you. I can't. I'll call her later. I'll tell her. Diane looks at Charles. He's still watching his daughter. Caroline's TEACHER prepares her lesson plan. She starts to write the date on the board when The door opens. Caroline and Tyler enter. The entire class is watching. It's dead quiet. Caroline puts her trembling hands in her pockets. Tyler looks at a few of the girls. They look back, unconcerned, almost amused. Tyler walks his sister to her desk.  You okay? Caroline nods, although her eyes are brimming. As she slips out of her jacket, the contents of her pockets clatter noisily to the floor. Tyler immediately bends to help her. Have you done something different with your hair? I love it! headlights. Okay, okay. Enough. 97. Tyler moves towards an EMPTY DESK. Some girls keep snickering. Suddenly, Tyler grabs the desk. THROWS it through the air. A JANITOR pushes a flat broom down the empty corridor when the glass from one of the classroom doors explodes as the desk makes impact. He stops pushing the broom and stares. Pin-drop silence. The students sit paralyzed. Tyler stares at the Mean Girl. Her arrogance completely gone. Caroline stares up at her brother, awestruck. bench with his hands behind his head and a bemused smirk. A You posted. Charles standing in the waiting area. Tyler is led out by the bailiff rubbing his wrists. He sees his father, his face registering surprise. Beat. The men walk together towards the exit in silence. Neither looking at the other. Destruction of private property and felony trespassing. I didn't call you. I know you didn't. Charles stops. 98. I have unleashed a raging shitstorm of epic proportions on the board of trustees of that pissant school that will not abate until those girls seek enrollment elsewhere. I give them a week. Beat. I know you think I'm a prick, but I have my uses. Guess so. Can you come by the office to talk to the lawyers? Beat. Tyler deciding. Tyler nods. Charles appraises his son. Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime. Charles walks ahead, pulling out his cell phone. Tyler calls after him. Thank you for bailing me out. Charles, without turning around, No problem. Tyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the crowd. No mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her. 99. Shakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but walks next to him. Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline with him. Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally watches from a bench. As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early September tanning possibilities. Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her. Beat. Using the little sister is dirty pool.  Is it working? Beat. Maybe. Tyler has a smile the size of New York City. Ally smiles back. Bright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep. Tyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light streaming in.  Hey...Hey. 100. Hmmm. I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office.  Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast? Whichever tastes better a la mode. Ally smiles. Say hi to your dad for me. Tyler watches her lying there. If I said I love you... what would you say?  I love you. I love you too. Tyler kisses her. Then heads out into the... Aidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he went out in the night before. Tyler watches him sleep.  French toast. Tyler smiles as he takes his journal and exits. Charles waiting on the doorstep, his Town Car waiting on the curb. Diane answers the door expecting to find Caroline's driver, she's confused to find... 101. Charles? Good morning Diane. What are you doing here? Tyler's coming by the office, but I thought I'd ride to school with Caroline first. Diane is speechless. This is a first. Um...OK...sure...yeah...great. She's not ready though, she's going to need at least twenty minutes. Charles hates waiting.  All right. Tyler chaining up his bike. His cellphone rings. He checks it. Knows what it's regarding before he answers. Are you canceling all together or are you just running late? Charles and Caroline in the back seat. She's on one side, with her pink back pack, he's on the other.  Are you already on your way? INTERCUT: Tyler rounding a corner. 102. I'm already here. I'm taking Caroline to school. He looks at his daughter. She looks back at him, then looks out the window. Tyler considers. Take your time. I'll just wait in your office. It may be a while. That's okay. Tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the street. Tyler riding in a handsome marble and oak elevator with a half-dozen EXECUTIVE types. Tyler steps on and presses the number 92. The doors close. Tyler walks, approaches the Receptionist from the ashtray incident. He smiles pleasantly. She doesn't. Janine in?  She went for coffee. She getting me any? Just kidding. Tyler heads down the hall. The Receptionist rolls her eyes. Tyler steps into his father's empty office. It's dark, quiet. He opens the blinds. Sunlight fills the room. 103. Tyler walks around the office. Picking things up, putting them back. Tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair. He leans back. Puts his feet up and his hands behind his head. Tyler notices the COMPUTER. He turns on the monitor and puts his hand on the mouse - but doesn't move it. His hand just stops and stays perfectly still. Tyler stares at the monitor where his dad's SCREEN SAVER is scrolling through PHOTOS... These photos are all of his FAMILY... "Michael's first Christmas, Tyler's eighth birthday, Diane in the hospital with Caroline in a pink blanket, Charles and his kids build a sand castle at the shore"... they just keep going. Tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life. That line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off. Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles watches her all the way into the school. His DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view mirror. Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an invite?" The Driver peels out. Ally has made a mess making french toast. Aidan is yakking on his phone. Charles in traffic. All around him DRIVERS curse, honk, hate each other. Charles rides, not letting it bug him. Caroline drawing at her desk as her Teacher comes in and gets ready to start the day. 104. Tyler is still watching the screen saver when Janine enters. Good Morning, Mister Roth. Did you know about this? Janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler and Michael naked in the tub pop up. She smiles. Who do you think scanned all the pictures? Tyler smiles. Janine smiles, Then a photo of Michael comes up. Those smiles fade. Silence. How old would he be? Twenty-nine last May. Tyler stands and looks out one of the floor-to-ceiling windows separated by columns. He stares out at mid town and a perfect blue sky. Janine looks befuddled. It's really been that long? I could've sworn it was... May 18, 1993. A silent moment passes. Janine reflecting. I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry. Tyler looks at her, his face easy... It's okay. Caroline's Teacher writes the date on the board as Caroline sits quietly doodling. The teacher looks her way. 105. Caroline? Hello? We're now looking at Tyler from just outside Charles' office window and we're PULLING BACK... Until we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily familiar grey metal siding... Until we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant white antenna... Until we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the... 92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center. A moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky. Then we hear the faint sound of AA Flight 11's ENGINES as it closes in on the North Tower. Silence. Darkness. We wait in it. Whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because... Charles Roth steps out of his car. His gaze fixed skyward. All around him the other DRIVERS mimic his behavior. It's a good bet... Diane sweeping cigarette butts off the stoop. Nobody else will... 106. Diane joins a group of ONLOOKERS staring up from a street corner in Brooklyn where the black smoke stains the blue sky. One of them has a radio to his ear. Michael... Diane staring at it. Someone's been trying to tell me something. Craig, through a LONG LENS standing by his car with the door open. He is, crystal clear, barking orders, while waves of blue and slashes of orange float around him. Maybe it's you... Aidan and Ally absolutely frantic on the roof. Holding hands. Craning to see. Ash begins to float down on them. It gets caught in Ally's hair. This girl! Ally! Her life, even the nightmare parts seeped into me and I swear to God I can hear you better. A door flies open. Caroline runs out into the empty hall, to the exit. What's that about? I've always been the worst listener. falling like snow flakes coating the streets and the sidewalks. Amongst the memos and faxes that will now never be sent and never received we find... 107. TYLER'S JOURNAL. Someone comes into your life... A light rain falls. Two TOMBSTONES stand side-by-side. May 20, 1969 May 18, 1993 June 17, 1978 September 11, 2001 Charles, Caroline, Diane and Les approach the tombstones. A family mourning. Diane slips her hand through Charles' elbow. The gesture seems quite natural, easy. We find Ally, with a ROOMMATE, putting up lively, Indian Print curtains in their NYU dorm. Caroline literally dragging Charles into the ROSE BUILDING AT And half of you says "Danger! Stay in your cave! You're nowhere near ready!" Caroline has come to the end of her rope with her dad. She grabs his phone and throws it into the fountain, spins on her heel and marches into the auditorium. Charles is completely thunderstruck. And the other half -- and this is the part I think is you -- He is torn between his phone and his daughter for a sec, chooses Caroline and takes off after her... ...then comes running out by himself to rescue his phone. 108. Craig is wearing a jacket and tie. He's on a date with a pretty WOMAN. In his confusion over the menu, he knocks over a glass of water. Says "Go get her! Immediately! Make her yours forever!" A chaotic place, filled with folk who need help. Diane at a desk, organizing families. I'm working on the forever part. Aidan actually awake in class. He has a tattoo on his forearm. "Tyler". I'm going to have to step up my game. But I'm glad I listened. Ally, we find her as we first found her mother, silhouetted against the Lower Manhattan skyline where two beams of purple light reach up forever where the Towers once stood. I love you. Her train pulls into the station. Ally boards with a few other commuters. She takes a seat by herself across from... A MOM and A TODDLER, a little girl. The baby is squirming impossibly, the mom looks exhausted. Ally watches them, remembers him, as the faintest hint of a smile crosses her lips the subway lights flicker and we... Don't be a stranger.
