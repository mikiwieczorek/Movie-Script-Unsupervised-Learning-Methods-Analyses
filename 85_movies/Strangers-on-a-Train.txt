Don't you see that just one word from him would extricate Guy from this dreadful situation? MRS. ANTONY  Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this thing must be some practical joke. You know, Bruno sometimes goes too far.  Of course I shouldn't be saying this to an outsider, but sometimes he's terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades.

He shouldn't have sent you on an errand like this. Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony. He's been leading you up the garden path, I'm afraid. He must be very desperate to try to involve me.

Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he tried to get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his lighter so the police wouldn't find it? He dropped it there, you know, when -- well, that night. The whole thing's been worrying me so much. But of course I couldn't do it, Miss Burton. It would have been too risky. And besides, it would have made me an accessory. Miss Burton, I know how you feel. Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I have an urgent appointment.  I must go up and change. Now, I really must go...if you'll excuse me... ...And he said that if the police found your lighter there, that's all they'd need -- something to prove you were at the scene of the murder.

But, Guy, that'll be too late!  Didn't Bruno say that I wanted him together there one night after dark? Yes. Well, that's what's in his mind now. He's not going to expose himself in broad daylight, If I can finish off this match in three sets, I'll still get there in time. We're on in a few minutes, Guy.  How are you, Miss Morton. Okay, Tim.   Be right with you. Well, if Turley said to pick him up for questioning, let's pick him up! Let him have his game first, Hammond.
