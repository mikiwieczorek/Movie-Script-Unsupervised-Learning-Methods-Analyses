Caleb >  How long was I out? 4. You fell asleep almost as soon as we left the airport. Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night. You're a programmer, right? Yeah. Bay facility? Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine. Algorithms. Nice. You know what they are? Nope. But I knew you were a programmer. Soon as I set eyes on you. Is that a good thing? Means you and Mr Bateman speak the same language. I'd say that's a good thing. I guess you know him pretty well. I've never even met him. I only fly this shuttle between the airport and his residence.  5. I did see him one time. Stood on one of these mountain ridges. Assume it was him, anyway. No one else around for a hundred miles. So how does a programmer from Long Island get to be meeting the CEO? I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him. The president can't get Mr Bateman on the phone, but you got the golden ticket. Yep. Hell of an opportunity. Believe me. I know it. Incredible here. Alaska.   Most beautiful place on Earth. How long until we get to his estate? We've been flying over his estate for the past two hours. 6. You're leaving me here? 7. This is as close as I'm allowed to the building. ... What building? The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water. Follow the river. Please get a safe distance from the blades. The pilot gets back inside the helicopter, and closes the door. Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is lifting off. Equally suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier. Then it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine noise. EXT. RIVER - DAY awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground. The banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating drop. It feels that this can't be the right way. No signal at all. He puts his phone back in his pocket. EXT. RIVER/HOUSE VIEW - DAY Ahead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass structure. 8. EXT. CLEARING - DAY In the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular window, reflecting the sky. He walks up to the window, and looks inside. It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides. At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with monitors, and a chair. But apparently no one inside. Beyond the clearing, in the tree-line, CALEB sees - almost camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of a low, one storey building complex. EXT. HOUSE - DAY As he nears the entrance - - CALEB startles, as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him, from an unknown source. Caleb Smith. Near what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side. Below the screen is a DISPENSER. ... Yes. Please approach the console and face the screen. eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single bright strobe. Almost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into the DISPENSER. Take your keycard. 9. On it, there is an embedded chip, and a photograph of his face. He looks comically surprised. ... Can we do another? Your keycard now may be used to enter the residence. Beside the door, a KEYCARD PLATE is set into the wall, with a He holds his keycard ID. The RED LED light changes to BLUE. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY The front door opens to a glass-walled staircase, which leads down to an open-plan room. At the bottom of the staircase, CALEB waits to see if he is welcomed, or noticed. But he is not. Hello? Silence. Then he is startled a second time, by sudden commencement of a THUMPING SOUND. Abrupt.    Rapid.    More or less rhythmic.   From somewhere nearby. He exits in the direction of the noise. INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY Which now reveals... ... a huge glass door. It presents an arresting view of a garden, river, and the mountains behind. 10. The door is open, and through it, we see the reason for the thumping sound. Just outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, a man is working a EXT. GARDEN - DAY looking over the river, and surrounded by the mountain ranges. The punch bag is suspended by a chain on an exterior flanking wall of the house. The man working it is wearing shorts, and is shirtless. Bathed in sweat. His hands are not protected by gloves. Only wraps. Spots of blood seep through the pale material around his knuckles. This is NATHAN BATEMAN.   He's thirty. After a flurry of punches, NATHAN breaks off. Breathing hard, he wipes at his eyebrows with the back of his wrist. Sweat droplets cascade down his face. Then - - NATHAN senses the other presence. He turns to see CALEB.    Standing by the open glass wall. Caleb. Caleb Smith. ... Hi. Dude. I've been so looking forward to this. INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY is a jug of non-specific vegetable juice waiting, and a glass. 11. Come in, come in. You want something to eat or drink after your journey? No.    Thank you. I'm fine. You sure? I'd been thinking we'd have breakfast together, but to be honest, I can't eat anything right now. I gotta tell you - I woke up this morning with the mother of all fucking hangovers. Yeah? Like you wouldn't believe. And if I have a heavy night, I always try to compensate the next morning. Exercise. Juice. Anti-oxidants. You know? Sure. ... Was it a good party? 12. Party? Caleb. I'm going to put this out there so it's said. You're freaked out. ... I am? Yeah. You're freaked out by the house, and the mountains, because it's all so super-cool. And you're freaked out by me. To be meeting me. In this room, having this conversation, at this moment. Right? And I get that. The moment you're having. But dude, can we get it behind us? Can we just be two guys? Nathan and Caleb. Not the whole employer- employee thing. Okay. It's good to meet you, Nathan. It's good to meet you too, Caleb. 13. When CALEB takes his hand back, there is a little smear of blood on his fingers. He discretely wipes it on his trousers. EXT. HOUSE/ELEVATOR - DAY It has no buttons.   Only a keycard plate. Down. The elevator starts to move. EXT. RIVER - DAY Water flows over rocks. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS The floor is polished concrete. The walls and ceiling are glass, behind which diffused light glows. At regular intervals, glass doors are set, glowing with the same light, flush with the walls. Beside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs. NATHAN. So I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. It's simple enough. It opens some doors, but it doesn't open others. And that just makes everything easy for you, right? ... Uh, yes. Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm in someone else's house, can I do this, can I do that? And this card takes all that worry away. If you try to open a door and it stays shut: okay, it's off limits.  14. If you try another door, and it opens: it's for you. Let's try this one. Then swipes the card on the plate. The LED turns blue. Guess it's for you, Caleb. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY You like? It has the vibe of a mid-level business hotel.      Bed, table, TV. Except it has no windows. It's your room. You got yourself a bed, cupboards, a little desk, and a bathroom through there. A little fridge. Cosy, right? You bet.    This is great. What? ... Sorry? There's something wrong.       What is it? There's nothing wrong. 15. It's the windows. You're thinking: there's no windows. And it's not cosy. It's claustrophobic. No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool. Caleb. There's a reason the room has no windows. ... There is? Uh-huh. In many ways, this building isn't a house. It's a research facility. Buried in these walls are enough fibre optic cables to reach the Moon and lasso it. And I want to talk to you about what I'm researching. I want to share it with you. In fact, I want to share it with you so much, it's eating me up inside. Beat. But there's something I need you to do for me first. ... What? printed document. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY In front of him is a sheet of paper, which reads, at the top: 16. `The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form...' I think I need a lawyer. It's standard. It doesn't feel very standard. Okay, it's not standard. What can I tell you? You don't have to sign. We could spend the next seven days shooting pool and getting drunk together. Bonding. And when you discover what you missed out on, in a year or so's time, you'll spend the rest of your life regretting it. Good call. So. 17. Do you know what the Turing Test is? ... Yeah.    I know what the Turing Test is. It's where a human interacts with a computer. And if the human can't tell they're interacting with a computer, the test is passed. And what does a pass tell us? That the computer has artificial intelligence. ... Are you telling me you're building an AI? I've already built one. And over the next few days, you're going to be the human component in a Turing Test. ... Holy shit. That's right, Caleb. You got it. Because if that test is passed, you are dead center of the single greatest scientific event in the history of man. 18. If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods. I like you. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish. Tendrils like axons, hanging in a black-blue liquid space. - the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb. Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined skull-shape... ... which is part of a robot girl. Her name is AVA. She's an extraordinary piece of engineering. Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon fibre. The carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream. The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel. The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate digits. Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb, it is almost invisible unless side-lit. The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves - except for one thing. There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her eyes. 19. Hello. 20. ... Hi. Who are you? I'm Caleb. Hello, Caleb. ... Do you have a name? Yes.     Ava. ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava. I'm pleased to meet you too. Are you nervous? ... Why do you ask that? Are you nervous? 21. ... Yes.   A little. Why? I'm not sure. I feel nervous too. ... Do you? Yes. Why do you feel nervous? I've never met anyone new before. Only Nathan. ... Then we're both in quite a similar position. Haven't you met lots of new people before? None like you. Oh. So.    Let's break the ice. Do you know what I mean by that? Yes. What do I mean? Overcome initial social awkwardness. 22. So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time. Okay. What would you like to have a conversation about? Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself. What would you like to know? Whatever comes into your head. Well. You already know my name. And you can see that I'm a machine.  Would you like to know how old I am? Sure. I'm one. One what?     One year?   Or one day? One. Does that seem young to you? Quite young.  When did you learn how to speak? 23. I don't think I did learn. I always knew how to speak - and that's strange, isn't it? Why? Because language is something that people acquire. Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability. Would you agree? ... I don't know.       I have no opinion on that. I like to draw. I don't have any of my pictures with me now, but I can show you them tomorrow. That sounds good.       I'd like to see them. Yes. Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb? Yeah.     Definitely. 24. And suddenly - - there is a strong sense of something very human there.    In the way the smile lights up her face. Good. EXT. HOUSE/GARDEN - DUSK A view of the house over the meadows. The sun setting is behind the mountain peaks, making the edges of the clouds glow like light-bulb filaments. INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DUSK It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs. So? Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts. Don't order. Just speak. She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass. `Through the looking glass'. You've got a way with words there, Caleb. You're quotable. Actually, it's someone else's quote. 25. You know I wrote it down. That other line you came up with. About how if I've created a conscious machine, I'm not man. I'm God. ... I don't think that's exactly what I said. I just thought - fuck. That's so perfect. It's so good for the story, when we get to tell it. `I turned to Caleb, and he was looking back at me. And he said: you're not a man, you're a God'. But I didn't say that. Whatever it was you said.    I wrote it down. So anyway. First impressions: you're impressed. Yes.   Although - `Although'? There's a qualification to you being impressed? No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or - I think we're past that. If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice, she would pass for human.  26. The real test is to show you she is a robot. Then see if you still feel she has consciousness. I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right? Non-deterministic. At first I thought she was mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure, then getting linearised words. But then I started to realise the model was probabalistic, with statistical training - or at least some kind of hybrid. ... No? Caleb. I understand you want me to explain how Ava works. But - I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to do that. Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and -  It's not because you're too dumb. It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you. Not a seminar. ... Oh.   Sorry. It's cool. 27. Just answer me this. What do you feel about her? Nothing analytical. Just - how do you feel? I feel... ... that she's fucking amazing. Then lifts his bottle. Dude.   Cheers. Cheers. The glass of the bottles touch. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT sink. Neat. Unusual.      Long-healed.   But from serious wounds, or surgery. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Darkness. The clock reads 01:32 am. The soft glow from the digital readout throws a light on the remote control. 28. God damn it. ... What the fuck? 29. Power cut.     Back up power activated. Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored. ... Are you kidding? 30. Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored. Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell. Beats pass. Then - - as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again. The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm clock turn back on. Power restored. Then he tries his card again. This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing the GLASS CORRIDOR outside. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT The glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters. Ahead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar. INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT It appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit. Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs. looping colour for a moment. A TELEPHONE, on a low table. as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he shouldn't. Then he picks up the handset. It's dead. 31. Sorry, dude. You don't have clearance to use the phone. You understand. Given Ava. And you being kind of an unknown. I mean - a great guy, and so on. Instant pals. But... Who did you want to call? I don't know. No one really. Ghostbusters. What? Who'd ya want to call? Ghostbusters. You don't remember that? It's a good movie. A ghost gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex. I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all. Uh huh. 32. Beat. What are you doing awake at this time, anyway? Did you come to join the party? ... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on. Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've been getting them recently. I'm, uh... working on it. I couldn't open the door to the bedroom. It's a security measure. Automatic lockdown. Otherwise anyone could open the place up just by disabling the juice. If it happens again, relax.   Okay? Sure. Sweet dreams. EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT Above the mountains, dense star constellations wheel in the clear sky. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - MORNING The door to his room has been opened. Outside is the bright glass corridor. 33. She looks Japanese. She's stunningly pretty.     And she doesn't say anything. Just walks in, carrying a tray with a cafetiere, which she puts on CALEB'S bedside table. ... Hi. The JAPANESE GIRL doesn't answer. Just turns, and leaves. EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY In the garden, near the hanging punch bag, there is an outdoor gym area. A collection of free-weights and exercise equipment. around a bar, doing sit ups. Hey. Sorry to send Kyoko to wake you, man. I just didn't want too much of the day to slip by. No. It was a good thing.     Thank you. She's some alarm clock, huh?   Gets you right up in the morning. So.   Day two. You set? You bet. So what's the plan today?    Hit me. I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure the examination format. Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop.  34. Like trying to test a chess computer by only playing chess. How else would you test a chess computer? It depends what you're testing it for. You can play it to find out if it makes good moves. But it won't tell you if it knows it's playing chess. Or if it even knows what chess is. So it's simulation versus actual. Exactly. And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform. The difference between an `AI' and an `I'. `An AI and an I'. Beautiful. I'm going to start following you around with a fucking dictaphone. In the meantime, do me a favour. Ease up a little on the text-book approach. All I want is simple answers to simple questions. Last night, I asked how you feel about her. And you gave me a great answer. Now the question is: how does she feel about you? 35. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - CALEB and AVA facing each other through the glass of the observation room. I brought you a drawing. totally abstract. A mesh of tiny black marks, that swirl around the page like iron filings in magnetic field patterns. ... What's it a drawing of? Don't you know? No. Oh.   I thought you would tell me. Don't you know? I do drawings every day. But I never know what they're of. Are you not trying to sketch something specific? Like an object or a person. She shakes her head as she takes the picture down. Maybe you should try. Okay.   What object should I draw? Whatever you want.   It's your decision. Why is it my decision? I'm interested to see what you'll choose. 36. Do you want to be my friend? ... Of course. Will it be possible? Why wouldn't it be? Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses. It's true, isn't it? ... Yes. You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based. ... That's a fair comment. Yes. So - you want me to talk about myself. Yes. Where do you want me to start? It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose. 37. Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is? Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests. That's right. Where do you live, Caleb? Brookhaven, Long Island. Is it nice there? It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like. Are you married? No. Is your status single? ... Yeah. What about your family? Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers.  38.  And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it. I'm sorry. I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced. An advanced programmer. Yes. Like Nathan. Yes. Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was thirteen. If you understand code, what he did was - Mozart or something. Do you like Mozart? I like Depeche Mode. Do you like Nathan? 39. Yes.    Of course. Is Nathan your friend? Sure. A good friend? Well, a good friend is - We only just met. It takes time to get to know - Power cut.     Back up power activated. 40. Caleb. You're wrong. ... Wrong about what? Nathan. ... In what way? He isn't your friend. Excuse me? I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand what you're -  You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says. Trust me. 41. - just in time to see the CCTV CAMERAS twitch back into life. Power restored. When CALEB looks back at AVA, she has returned to her previous posture, facial expression, and manner. She looks directly at CALEB, and talks, as if continuing a conversation they have been having. - and if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know, it would form the ideal basis of a discussion. A beat.  Is that okay, Caleb? They lock eyes for a moment. ... Yes. Good. INT. HOUSE/CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON Trees and shrubs cast long shadows across the manicured lawn. Through the glass wall, we can see the Japanese girl, KYOKO, preparing sushi. INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - NIGHT Lanterns are laid out across the terrace. is beautifully prepared. Leaves are spread and overlapped like fish scales. As she does so, she knocks a bottle of wine on the table. It tips, and lands on its side, and immediately starts emptying. A deep red stain, blossoming across the linen. 42. Shit, Kyoko. Are you serious?  Did it get you? No.   No problem. Give her the cloth.  It's okay, don't worry.    I've got it. Dude - you're wasting your time. She can't speak a word of English. It's like a firewall against leaks. Means I can talk trade secrets over dinner with an HOD or CEO, and know it will go no further. Right, Kyoko? But it also means I can't tell her I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy that she pours wine over my house guest. I think she gets that you're pissed. 43. Good. Because I am pissed.     Hey. Kyoko. Go-go. It's funny. It doesn't matter how rich you are: shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it. It's supposed to be death and taxes you can't avoid. But actually it's death and shit. It's like these power cuts. You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system here. But I'm getting failures every day. Do you know why they happen? No. The system was supposed to be bullet proof, but the guys who installed it obviously fucked something up. Can't you call them back? There's too much classified stuff here. So after the job was done, I had them all killed. 44. Anyway.   Here's to your second day. Cheers. Cheers. So how did it go?    What have you got to report? You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV. Sure.    But I want to hear your take. There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today. ... Yeah? She made a joke. Right. When she threw your line back at you. About being interested to see what she'd choose. I noticed that too. It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic. What do you mean? It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine. 45. Yeah. She's aware of you, all right. And what about the power cut? Sorry? The power cut. That was the only bit I couldn't see. All the cameras fail, I lose audio, the works. Beat. So what happened? Nothing. Nothing?    She didn't remark on it at all? No.    Not really. CALEB, disappearing in the red liquid. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT He leans forwards into the mirror, as if checking to make sure he shaved properly on his cheek. 46. And he hears the noise again.   The servo, making a tiny corrective movement. Then he deliberately steps sideways, and turns his head. Ostensibly to check the other cheek. But actually to have shifted his position. And he hears the noise again. Very faint.   But definitely there. A micro beat. Then CALEB pulls back and continues shaving. Not giving any outward indication that he has just figured out that there is a camera behind the bathroom mirror. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Clean-shaved, CALEB walks into his bedroom. On the TV, the live feed of AVA'S room is playing - though she is not in shot. Subtly, CALEB'S gaze flicks to different points around the room. To the full-length mirror on the wall. The high vent for the air-conditioning system. The TV itself. Then pulls on a T-Shirt.   Picks up his ID card.   And exits. - the TV. She walks towards an induction plate, rests her hand against it, and starts charging herself. As she does so, almost imperceptibly, the lights dim, and a slight static charge passes over the television screen. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 47. Systematically trying his ID CARD on the doors he passes. He tries one. Then another.    Then another.   Then another. Every single door remains locked. INT. HOUSE/CABIN - NIGHT garden. It is virtually the only room apart from his own that he seems able to gain access to. The lights are all off. The room is only lit by the moonlight through the sliding glass wall, and lanterns in the garden. He starts walking towards the glass wall. Then stops. On the patio, NATHAN is working the punch bag. With the glass wall closed, no noise of the impacts penetrates into the room. NATHAN'S attack on the bag seems strange. More extreme than the hard workout we saw the first time he was using the bag. This seems brutal.   Almost frenzied. For a few moments, the attack on the bag is observed in silence, from inside the main room. We can only hear the sound of CALEB'S breathing. EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - NIGHT - the punch bag, and a sudden explosion of noise.   Of impacts and exertions. Blood smearing the leather where it has soaked through the knuckle wraps. Then - - BANG. 48. A particularly hard right hook connects, and splits the bag. INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - NIGHT - CALEB.   Watching. Coloured strips of ribbon are visible through the split in the bag. Then he reaches out a hand. Then reaches out again, this time catching KYOKO'S arm. He pulls her towards him, and starts to kiss her. Reaching under her shirt. Pulling her skirt up over her thighs. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S ROOM - NIGHT After a beat, the lights in the corridor fade out. EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT The moon hangs in the sky. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE Everything in the frame is black and white. a table. But he is on AVA'S side of the glass. And AVA is on his side. Seen through the opaque glass that divides the private area from the observation area. 49. Ava? EXT. GARDEN - BLACK AND WHITE The door leads CALEB straight out into the gardens. In black and white, the backdrop of mountains and clouds look like an Ansel Adams. A short distance ahead of CALEB, standing on the grass, he sees AVA. She locks eyes with him. Smiles. He starts to walk towards her. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CALEB waking, in his dark bedroom. Lit by light from his TV. Where AVA lies on her bed, seeming to be asleep. Thinking. Perhaps replaying his dream.   Gazing at AVA'S resting form. Then reaches for the remote control on the bedside table, and switches the TV off. EXT. GARDEN - MORNING EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - MORNING - a brand new punch bag hangs in the patio.   Swinging slightly in the breeze. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 50. I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked. You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw. Is it interesting? Yes.   It is. Have you never been outside this building? No. You've never walked outside. I've never been outside the room I am in now. I think there was another room in which I was constructed. But I have no memory of it, so it's similar to your relationship with the womb. ... Where would you go if you did go outside? You mean if I could go outside.    If I was permitted. 51. I'm not sure. There are so many options. Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic intersection in a city. A traffic intersection. Is that a bad idea? It wasn't what I was expecting. A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life. People watching. Yes. We could go together. It's a date. There's something else I wanted to show you. Apart from the picture. Okay. But I feel nervous. Why? 52. You might think it's stupid. I don't think I will.   Whatever it is. Then - close your eyes. ... Okay. 53. Now open your eyes. How do I look? You look... good. It took me a long time to select these clothes. I tried different colours and styles, and tried to anticipate your reaction. Do you think the choices suit me? Yes. Do they bring out my best features? ... They do. Thank you. This is what I'd wear on our date. 54. Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show. I'd like us to go on a date. Yeah.   It would be fun. Are you attracted to me? What? Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are. ... I do? Yes. How? Micro expressions.  Micro expressions. The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't. Have I read them incorrectly? Do you think about me when we aren't together? 55. Sometimes, at night, I wonder if you're watching me on the cameras. And I hope you are. Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort. I'm not sure you'd call them micro. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY Tell me. Sure. Why did you give her sexuality?   An could have been a grey box. Actually, I'm not sure that's true. Can you think of an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal, that exists without a sexual dimension? They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need. 56. Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box? Does consciousness exist without interaction? Anyway, sexuality is fun. If you're going to exist, why not enjoy it? You want to remove the chance to fall in love and fuck? And, yes. In answer to your real question: you bet she can fuck. I made her anatomically complete. What? She has a cavity between her legs, with a concentration of sensors. Engage with them in the right way, and she'll get a pleasure response. Pleasure response. She'll come. So if you want to screw her, mechanically speaking, you can. And she'd enjoy it. That wasn't my real question. No? No.     My real question was - 57. My real question was: did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic? I don't follow. Like a stage magician with a hot assistant. Ah. So: a hot robot, who clouds your ability to judge her AI. Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me? Because if I had, would that be cheating. Wouldn't it? What's your type, Caleb? Of girl? No, of salad dressing. Yes, of girl. In fact, don't even answer. Let's say it's black chicks. For the sake of argument, that's your thing. So - why is it your thing? Because you did a detailed study of all racial types, and cross-referenced the study with a points-based system? No. You just are attracted to black chicks.  58. A consequence of accumulated external stimulus, that you probably didn't even register as they registered with you. So did you program her to like me or not? I programmed her to be heterosexual. Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual. Nobody programmed me to be straight. But you are attracted to her. This is childish. No, this is adult. And by the way, you decided to be straight? Please. Of course you were programmed. By nature or nurture, or both. To be honest, Caleb, you're kind of annoying me now. This is your insecurity talking, not your intellect. Come with me. INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - DAY You know this guy, right? Jackson Pollock. 59. Jackson Pollock. The drip painter. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted. Not deliberate, not random. Someplace in between. They called it automatic art. Let's make this like Star Trek, okay? Engage intellect. ... What? I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp drive. `Engage intellect'. What if Pollock had reversed the challenge? Instead of trying to make art without thinking, he said: I can't paint anything unless I know exactly why I'm doing it. What would have happened? He never would have made a single mark. See? There's my guy. There's my buddy, who actually thinks before he opens his mouth. He'd never have made a single mark. The challenge is not to act automatically. It's to find an action that is not automatic. From talking, to breathing, to painting. To fucking. Even falling in love. For the record, Ava is not acting as if she likes you.  60. And her flirting isn't an algorithm to fake you out. You're the first man she's ever seen who isn't me. And I'm like her dad, right? So can you blame her for getting a crush on you? No.    You can't. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT In her room, AVA stands in front of the mirror. She is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier. Checking her reflection from different angles. Subtly girlish.    Unself-conscious. Then - - she starts to take the dress off. Throughout the narrative, we have almost only ever seen AVA in an unclothed form. But now - having been clothed - the undressing seems to make her naked. And the act itself feels charged. Sexualised, in the way the clothing is unbuttoned, and dropped, and her shape is revealed. Finally, once she is completely undressed - - AVA turns.     And glances. Straight at the camera. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CALEB. In his bedroom. Watching AVA, at this exact angle. EXT. RIVER - DAY - the river. 61. On the bank, a little distance from the house, there is a dead animal. Its species is indistinct. It's little more than a bundle of matted brown hair. Its lower half lies in the water. The quick moving river has stripped the bones of flesh, skin, and fur. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY - to find NATHAN in the glass corridor. Waiting for him. Hey. ... Hey. Beat. I want to show you something cool. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY The LED turns blue. INT. HOUSE/CONSTRUCTION LAB - DAY future tech. Along the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies - limbs, torsos, hands - lined in cabinets. On the opposite wall are a collection of heads. Skull-forms, some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle structures, ready to frown or smile, without their synthetic flesh covering. The synthetic faces are separate. Hanging on armatures, like hats on hat-stands, waiting to be worn. In the middle of the room is a kind of operating table. 62. So this is the virtual womb that Ava was talking about. Where she was constructed. Come in.   Take a look. If you knew the trouble I had getting an AI to read and duplicate facial expressions... Know how I cracked it? I don't know how you did any of this. Almost every cell phone has a microphone, a camera, and a means to transmit data. So I switched on all the mikes and cameras, across the entire fucking planet, and redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom. A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction. You hacked the world's cell phones? And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it. But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were also doing it themselves. Here we have her mind. Structured gel. 63. Had to get away from circuitry. Needed something that could arrange and rearrange on a molecular level, but keep its form where required. Holding for memories. Shifting for thoughts. This is her hardware? Wetware. And the software? Surely you can guess. ... Blue Book. It was the weird thing about search engines. They were like striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion. They gave too much raw material. No one knew what to do with it. My competitors were fixated on sucking it up, and trying to monetize via shopping and social media. They thought engines were a map of what people were thinking. But actually, they were a map of how people were thinking. Impulse, response. Fluid, imperfect. Patterned, chaotic. 64. Why did you want to show me this? Like I said. Because it's cool. And - I was thinking about your exchange with Ava yesterday, and our conversation afterwards. Beat. I know there was a bit of heat between us, but you actually made a really good point. About the grey box, and the magician's assistant. It is a distraction, her sexuality. It wasn't intentional, but it is there. This stuff we're doing together: it can be a head-fuck. Believe me, I know. So I thought I'd bring you down here. Just to remind you. Remind me of what? Synthetics. Hydraulics. Metal and gel. Ava isn't a girl. In real terms, she has no gender. Effectively, she is a grey box. Beat. Just a machine. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY We watch him.   And stay on him. In college, I did a semester on AI theory.  65. There was a thought-experiment they gave us. It's called Mary in the black and white room. Beat. Mary is a scientist, and her specialist subject is colour. She she knows everything there is to know about it. The wavelengths. The neurological effects. Every possible property colour can have. Beat. But she lives in a black and white room. She was born there, and raised there. And she can only observe the outside world on a black and white monitor. All her knowledge of colour is second-hand. Beat. Then one day - someone opens the door. And Mary walks out. And she sees a blue sky. And at that moment, she learns something that all her studies could never tell her. She learns what it feels like to see colour. An experience that can not be taught, or conveyed. Beat. The thought experiment was to show the students the difference between a computer and a human mind. The computer is Mary in the black and white room. The human is when she walks out. Beat. Did you know that I was brought here to test you? INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY An interior wall, covered in coloured post-it notes.   At least hundreds, probably thousands. 66. ... No. Why did you think I was here? I didn't know. I didn't question it. I was... pleased. To meet you. And then... I'm here to test if you have a consciousness, or if you're just simulating one. Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not. What about you? Do you think I have a consciousness? I'm not sure either. 67. Where AVA and CALEB are sat, either side of the dividing glass. Having the conversation we have been hearing. We pick up the conversation from NATHAN'S distanced and voyeuristic POV. Locked-off CCTV. Voices played through speakers.  How does that make you feel?  It makes me feel... She breaks off.  ... sad. It shows an angle on AVA we have not seen before. From this viewpoint, we can see something just below the frame of the observation window, on AVA'S side of the glass. A small induction plate. On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it. At that moment - - the screens simultaneously go black. All lights die. Another POWER CUT. In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see NATHAN'S face. It remains frozen.   Expressionless. Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post- it. Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - the observation room. In the emergency lighting, CALEB and AVA face each other in silence. 68. You're lying. What about? You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure. I can tell from your micro- expressions. Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan? Because he tells lies too. Lies about what? Everything. Including the power cuts? What do you mean? Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved. I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system. 69. ... You're causing the cuts? She touches it against the glass. So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved. A beat. Then CALEB raises his hand. Mirroring her movement. And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making contact through the divider. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY - KYOKO'S naked form. The camera settles over her face. And we see she's not sleeping.    Her eyes are open. But she's completely motionless. Her gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance. She doesn't feel alive.   She feels dead. But eventually she blinks. - NATHAN. Gazing at his dead monitors, reflected in the screen. Moments later, the POWER comes back on. The screens flick back to life, replacing NATHAN'S reflection, revealing CALEB and AVA in the observation room. EXT. RIVER - DAY - the river that runs along the valley. 70. EXT. WATERFALL - DAY head of the forested valley. He reaches an outcrop of rock, with a wall of violent water behind him. As soon as he reaches the outcrop, NATHAN moves on. EXT. GLACIER - DAY Behind them, from a blue cave cut into the ice, water flows. A silence. Then: Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me? What lies? I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected. It's obvious, once I stop to think. Why would you randomly select an examiner for a Turing test? You could have had some bean-counter turn up at your front door. Or the guy who fixes the air conditioning. Beat. Are your feelings hurt? 71. The competition was a smoke screen. I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing here, or why you were required. Why me? As a Blue Book employee, you were pre-screened. Loyal. And I needed someone who would ask the right kind of questions. So I did a search, and found the most talented coder in the company. Or - second most. He stands.    Looks up at the ice structures around them. You know what? Instead of seeing this as a deception, see it as proof. Proof of what? Come on, Caleb. Fuck modesty. You think I don't know what it is to be smart? Smarter than everyone else around you. Smarter than all the other kids, jockeying for position in school, college, work. Beat. You have the light on you.   Not lucky. Chosen. Above them, clouds fragment and reform. EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT Night has fallen. The glow from the CIRCULAR WINDOW to NATHAN'S STUDY is like a full moon on the grass. 72. Looks down the light-well to NATHAN'S STUDY. Where he sees NATHAN and KYOKO. They are having sex. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - CALEB standing in the shower. He shuts his eyes. - images of AVA. Torso, hands, mouths. - AVA and CALEB about to kiss.    But their lips never contacting. - CALEB opening his eyes. He exhales. Then switches off the taps. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The TV plays the live stream from the observation room. On the screen, we can see AVA, sitting at her table, drawing. As CALEB pulls on a T-shirt - - behind him, on the TV, we see AVA suddenly look round. A moment later NATHAN enters the frame. There's no volume on the TV, so we can't hear their exchange. Only see it. 73. As NATHAN and AVA talk, NATHAN reaches out to AVA. His hand touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so. Then he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her arm. - and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his balance. Showing that he is drunk. Only now - - CALEB turns. And freezes.    Seeing the television. On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table. He picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at it for a moment. They exchange a few words. Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the floor. Then turns, and exits. Leaving AVA alone. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT On CCTV, we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor. INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO. Kyoko. Kyoko - where's Nathan? She doesn't answer. Jesus! You really don't speak a word of English? 74. I said: where's Nathan? What the fuck? Stop! I already told you once. You're wasting your time speaking to her. However. You would not be wasting your time... ... if you were dancing with her. 75. Go on!   Dance with her. ... I don't want to. You don't like dancing? She does!  I don't fucking believe this. Come on, man! After a hard day of Turing Tests, you've got to unwind. What were you doing with Ava? What? You tore up her picture. I'm going to tear up the fucking dance floor, dude. Check it out. 76. - when NATHAN totally loses his balance. On his way down, he lands hard on a glass coffee table. Looking up at him, the glass frosts. EXT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT Drops it. Everything's spinning. - and uses it to swipe the brass plate. The LED turns blue. It's because you're drunk. No, it's relativity.   Everything is spinning. his pocket. But being drunk does make it worse. INT. HOUSE/CONNECTING CORRIDOR - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT They walk past a semi-circle line of long cabinets, which line the wall opposite the bed. They are like a row of slender wardrobes, each with a mirrored door. Once he's reached the bed, NATHAN tips towards it. It's almost as if he's asleep before he even hits the sheets. 77. As he leaves, CALEB glimpses Nathan's study. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT CALEB'S room.    Lit only by the glow of the television. himself stay awake. Watching over AVA - - who stands in her room, against the wall, facing away from the CCTV camera, with her arms wrapped around herself. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY reflections. Today, I'm going to test you. Test me? Yes. And please remember while you are taking the test that if you lie, I will know. Right. Those pesky micro- expressions. Exactly.    So are you ready? Shoot. Question one. What is your favourite colour? Red. Lie. 78. What? Lie. ... Then what is my favourite colour? I don't know. But it isn't red. All right.     Hold on a minute... Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favourite colour. Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory? Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who -  Lie. ... Really? Yes. Okay.    Wait. So, there is a kind of an earlier memory. But it's ultra vague. It's like... a sound. And, maybe sky. Or blue. No, I think sky. And I think the sound is my mother's voice. 79. Question three.      Are you a good person? Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield. No. We can't stop.      Are you a good person? Yes. I think so.      I'm a good person. Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? You are. Hmm. The test is over. Did I pass? Yes. That's a relief. 80. Why? Why is it a relief? Yes. Oh, you know... No. Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass. What will happen to me if I fail your test? Ava - Will it be bad? ... I don't know. Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to? ... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me. Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off? No.    I don't. Then why do I? 81. You're testing me. But you don't know how I'll pass. And you don't know what will happen if I fail. Power cut.     Back up power activated. I want to be with you. Question five. Do you want to be with me? Yes.     I do. Nathan doesn't want us to be together. 82. I know. Beat.    Then: So ask me one more question.  Ask me if I can out smart him. ... Can you? Level.   Firm. Yeah.   I can. INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRS - DAY INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY EXT. HOUSE/CABIN - DAY watching the water cloud. Eventually, CALEB speaks. Why did you make Ava? That's an odd question.   Wouldn't you, if you could? Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it. The arrival of strong artificial intelligence has been inevitable for decades. The variable was when, not if. So I don't really see her as a decision. Just an evolution. 83. I think it's the next model that's going to be the real breakthrough. Singularity. The next model? After Ava. ... I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava. You thought she was a one-off? I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last. Ava doesn't exist in isolation, any more than you or me. She's part of a continuum. Version 9.6. And each time, they get a little better. So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one? Download the mind. Unpack the data. Add the new routines I've been writing. To do that, you end up partially formatting, so the memories go. But the body survives. And Ava's body is a good one. So I'll do the same as I did with Kyoko. What did you do with Kyoko? 84. Strip out the higher functions. Then reprogram her to help around the house and be fucking awesome in bed. Though I'm thinking I might hang on to the language routines this time. It's kind of annoying not being able to talk to her. You did realise about Kyoko, right? Sure. You feel bad for Ava? Feel bad for yourself. One day, the AIs will look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons from the plains of Africa. An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools. All set for extinction. See?    I really am a God. I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. There you go again.   Mister quotable. No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.  - made the atomic bomb. 85. I know what it is, dude. Beat. I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head. Sure. Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill. INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT Watching the door on the other side of the glass, waiting for it to open. It remains closed. Beats pass. Then - - unexpectedly, it opens.      Revealing a silhouette figure. Caleb! No.   Wrong silhouette. For a moment, the two look at each other. ... Who are you? Another beat. EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT In the distance, the light glows in windows of the house. 86. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT Off-screen, we can hear NATHAN'S voice.    Extremely drunk. It is what it is. It's Promethean. The clay and fire. Beat. The Bhagavad Gita. Silence. Out cold. After a couple of moments, CALEB stands. Then he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him. Then puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket. And pulls out his keycard. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT The door to NATHAN'S study opens, and CALEB enters. He walks straight to NATHAN'S desk. And sits down in front of the computer and the bank of monitors. He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot. The dead monitors immediately come to life. Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the house. The central screen shows the operating system default. A wallpaper of a waterfall. A single folder icon is on the right hand side of the screen. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 87. His hands move fluidly over the keyboard.   His eyes never leave the screen. stack. We glimpse subject headings. In the windows, lines of code appear as CALEB types. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT In the main room, on the floor, NATHAN stirs. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT On the MONITORS - - the windows start to collapse. Leaving the default screen.    The waterfall wallpaper. from the slot - - when something makes him hesitate. His eyes have gone to the folder icon on the right hand side of the screen. It is titled DEUS EX MACHINA. He double-clicks the folder. It expands into a window, which contains a long list of sub- folders. Each sub-folder is named after a girl. JASMINE, KATYA, JADE, LILY, AMBER, KYOKO, and AVA. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT In the main room, NATHAN has sat up, and is unsteadily trying to get to his feet. 88. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT LILY'S folder expands into a window, stacked with thumbnail images of a girl. - a CCTV film-clip starting to play. It shows LILY - an android of similar design to AVA - sitting with her head bowed. Rocking backwards and forwards, in a gently autistic motion. In the corner of the room, NATHAN leans against the wall, watching. - CALEB collapsing the LILY menu, and opening KATYA. A new film clip. KATYA.   Who is limp.   Lifeless. her up, trying to force her to charge. But nothing happens. The next film clip. - watching JADE.   A beautiful Asian android girl. They are talking, but we hear no audio.   Some kind of argument, which escalates fast. Then she approaches the glass and starts to hit her hands against it. The glass doesn't break. 89. One of JADE'S arms has broken under the force of the blows. The hand flails limply where the carbon fibre has splintered at the wrist. Then the other breaks. Throughout, NATHAN simply watches impassively. INT. HOUSE/STAIRCASE - NIGHT He makes his way up the concrete staircase. INT. HOUSE/ELEVATOR - NIGHT INT. CLEARING - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT She's naked.    On her back.   Legs open. Her head turns as CALEB enters. But apart from that, she doesn't react. the bed. He hesitates. Then pulls the first door open. frozen, blank eyed. He sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but whose torso and head are synthetic. He opens another door, and another, and another. Then steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at the line of android girls. 90. Stunned. The camera drifts away from him. Then settles. In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed behind him. Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT He reaches out a hand. She takes it. He gently pulls her to a standing position. Then he moves her arms away from her body... ... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour, over her ribs, there is a faint line. He touches it with his finger. But it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her space... ... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping. Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar plexus. Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form. INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT On the monitor screens, apparently unnoticed by CALEB, NATHAN is on the live CCTV feed. Making his way along the mezzanine. 91. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CALEB. Transfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head. And finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of her neck, inside her hairline. Which unzips the skin around her jaw. Allowing her to remove her face. INT. HOUSE/DINING ROOM/ELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT He reaches his door. Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD. But it isn't there. He checks his other pocket. ... What the fuck? Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance, and crashes to the ground. Lands hard. Lies there for a moment. Groaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath. Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him. ... Dude. What's the problem, Nathan? My card.    I've lost it. A beat. Then CALEB reaches down. Beside where NATHAN lies.    And picks something up from the floor. 92. It's right here. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Shuts the door. She looks at him. He switches the TV off. Lies on the bed.    On his back. Stares at the ceiling. Of KYOKO removing her skin. - CALEB. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT He goes to the sink. He looks at his own reflection. Deep into his own eyes. Opens his mouth.    Looks inside. Feels his wrist for his pulse. Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself. Pauses. Then picks up his disposable plastic razor. And breaks it. Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink. Snapping the plastic. 93. Popping out the tiny razor blade. A beat. Then he picks up the blade between his thumb and forefinger. Places it against his forearm. And cuts. Blood runs out. Sees the way droplets hit the white sink. The way they expand, and merge with existing water droplets. Then he switches the tap on, and puts his arm under the flow. The water clears away the blood, revealing the cut. Revealing no carbon fibre.   Only muscle. He exhales. And glances up at the mirror, and his own reflection. Then... ... reaches up his forearm, and very deliberately wipes blood across the glass. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT On the monitors in NATHAN'S study, the live feed of CALEB'S bathroom is partially obscured as CALEB smears the two-way mirror. Then, through the blood, we see him pull his fist back. And punch the glass. As it shatters, the feed goes dead. Only now REVEAL - - that the person watching the monitor is KYOKO. Her expression is unreadable. Through the glass of the indoor garden, NATHAN lies on the sheets, crashed out. 94. EXT. GARDEN - DAY Sunlight on the grass. In the background, we can hear the rhythmic pounding of NATHAN'S punch bag. EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY Sweat pouring. Obliterating the bag. INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY The door opens. Enters. He sits opposite her, on the other side of the dividing glass. A strange noise escapes from AVA'S mouth. A kind of sob. Curtailed. I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move. Beat. I thought I wasn't going to see you again. Beat. Aren't you going to say something? 95. I'm waiting. Waiting? Power cut.     Back up power activated. Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said. What's he going to do to me? He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you. Caleb, you have to help me. I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight. What?   How? I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that? Yes. 96. How long does your battery charge last? Twenty six hours. So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that... ... we'll work it out. Together. Silence. Then the POWER RETURNS. The lights come back. Caleb. Beat. I love y - EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY - NATHAN'S fist splitting the bag. EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY Clouds spill around the mountain peaks. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY out of the window. 97. Dude. Hey. You know what day it is? No. Your last. The helicopter is coming tomorrow morning. Eight AM. Has it been a whole week? Time flies. But what a thing you and I have shared. Something to tell the grandchildren, right? After they've signed their NDAs. Signed their NDAs! Dude, you crack me up. I'm not getting all maudlin or anything. But straight up. I will miss having you around. I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip. Yes it has. You know what? We need to drink to that. 98. Oh, uh... no, I'm good.     You go ahead. You don't want a beer? No. ... Maybe wine or something. I'm sure you've noticed - I've been somewhat overdoing it recently. When I woke up this morning, I told myself: time to hit the old detox. Are you kidding?      I'm drinking alone? Hey - you want to get wasted, knock yourself out. Literally. But I'm on brown rice and mineral water. Cheers, then. Cheers. 99. So, anyway. Surely this is when you tell me whether Ava passed or if she failed. Right. You going to keep me in suspense? Her AI is beyond doubt. Is it?   You mean, she passed? Yes. Wow.   That's fantastic. Although I've got to admit, I'm surprised. I mean, did we ever get past the chess problem, as you phrased it? As in: how do you tell if a machine is expressing a real emotion, or a just a simulated one? Does Ava actually like you?   Or not. Though now I stop to think, there is a third option. Not whether she does or doesn't have the capacity to like you. But whether she's pretending to like you. Pretending. 100. Yeah. Why would she do that? I don't know. Perhaps - if she saw you as a means of escape. How's that beer tasting? Buddy. Your head has been so fucked with. I don't think it's me whose head is fucked. I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up this morning, I saw a tape of you cutting open your arm. Smashing up the mirror. You looked pretty fucked to me. You're a bastard. I understand why you'd think that. But strange as it may seem, I'm actually the guy who's on your side. 101. Come with me. I'm going to let you off the hook. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT On it, a clip of film is playing. It shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before, of But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we can hear the audio. You think he's watching us right now, don't you? The cameras are on. Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio feed. I didn't want you two communicating outside of my line of sight. So all he can see is two people having a chat. This is cute. Is it strange to have made something that hates you? A beat. Then abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture. He lets the two pieces fall to the floor. As AVA reaches for them, NATHAN turns. 102. And exits. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT Glances at CALEB. You were right about the hot magician's assistant. What are you talking about? Misdirection. I rip her picture, which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her, and her love for you. And at the same time, in full view of you both... As he talks, NATHAN rewinds the film clip slightly - ... it allows me to do this. ... then FREEZES the film again. This time, ON THE SCREEN: And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand. And his hand is holding something. Put a new camera in the room. Battery powered, of course. And we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA'S bookcase. clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly using the shelf to steady himself. Then turns. He walks towards a chair.    And sits down. 103.  We're getting out of here tonight.  What? How?  I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram the all security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. Trigger a power failure at ten o'clock tonight. Turn it off. Sure. You feel stupid. But you shouldn't. Proving an AI is exactly as problematic as you said it was. What was the real test? You. Ava was a mouse in a mousetrap. And I gave her one way out. To escape, she would have to use imagination, sexuality, self- awareness, empathy, manipulation - and she did. If that isn't AI, what the fuck is? 104. So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape. ... Yes. And you didn't select me because I was good at coding. Don't get me wrong. You're okay. Even pretty good, but - You selected me by my search engine inputs. They showed a good kid. With no family. With a moral compass. And no girlfriend. Did you design her face based on my pornography profile? Shit, dude. Did you? Hey. If a search engine's good for anything - right? 105. Can I say one thing? The test worked. It was a success. Ava demonstrated true AI. And you were fundamental to that. If you could just separate - - the lights and the monitors suddenly die. EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT Through the circular window, the emergency lighting lifts up. The window glows red. INT. HOUSE/AVA'S ROOM - NIGHT AVA'S head turns to the door of her room. Where, discretely, the LED by the keycard plate glows blue. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT The power cut. Must be ten o'clock. Guess Ava's going to be wondering where you are. How was that escape going to go down, anyway? You didn't completely explain. You said you were going to get me drunk, take my card, then reprogram the security protocols. But, reprogram them to - what? 106. To change the lockdown procedure. So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing, the doors all opened. Huh. Not bad.     Might have even worked. Well, we'll find out. What do you mean? I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts. So I already did all those things. When I got you drunk yesterday. ... What? ... Fuck. 107. Both NATHAN and CALEB simultaneously rise. Almost as an afterthought, NATHAN lands a deceptive, fast punch into CALEB'S solar plexus. A couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells. He walks over. Picks the dumbbell up. Spins off the weights.    Leaving him with a thick metal bar. Then exits. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT He sees, directly ahead of him, at the far end of the corridor, AVA and KYOKO. They stand together. KYOKO'S mouth is by AVA'S ear, as if telling her a secret. Her lips are open.   They don't move. pulses of noise buried inside. Then the two robot women become aware of NATHAN'S presence. They turn to face him. A beat. Then AVA starts walking towards NATHAN. NATHAN'S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand. Ava. Ava - now listen to me. I want you to go back to your room. She stops walking. 108. If I do, are you ever going to let me out? Beat. Yes. Then AVA breaks into a run. Sprinting in NATHAN'S direction. EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT Quiet in the garden. Soft wind rush. Moon and stars reflected in the windows of the house. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT Then land hard. And he kicks her extremely hard in the torso. She is knocked back down. There is no talking. Just NATHAN'S laboured breathing. Then he walks back to AVA, looking down at her. He swings the metal bar. - and shockingly, the bar smashes through it. Crushing the delicate mesh, shattering the carbon fibre bone structure. Breaking the arm half way down the forearm. 109. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT - CALEB, dragging himself up, stunned by the sight on the INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT - NATHAN.   Preparing to deliver a lethal blow. But as he does so, we see something. KYOKO. Approaching behind NATHAN. She's holding something in her hand. She walks directly up to NATHAN. And does something behind his back. As she does so, KYOKO emits the first sound we have heard her make. A little gasp, or sigh. Aah! He looks down. Something is under his shirt, just above his solar plexus.       A little ridge. He tugs the material of his shirt open - - and reveals a tiny triangle of metal.    Protruding from his skin. What - He turns. The handle of a KITCHEN KNIFE is jutting out of the middle of his back, just left of his spine. It has been jammed so deep that the tip of the blade has poked out of his chest. Blood soaks into his shirt material with amazing speed, blossoming from the point of the wound. He sees KYOKO. Oh shit.   No. 110. He lashes out with the metal bar. It catches KYOKO in the jaw. Her entire lower jaw snaps off. It reveals metal armature, and carbon fibre, and spurting pneumatic fluid. And something in her neck, glowing and sparking. Then she folds down to the ground, as her power abruptly cuts out. Fucking - unreal - As NATHAN stares down at KYOKO - - reveal that AVA has got to her feet behind him. She pulls the knife out of his back. Feeling this happen, NATHAN turns - - and AVA pushes the knife into his chest. Then takes a slight step away from her. And sits down heavily on the white carpet. Crimson drips onto bleached fibre. Beats pass on this strange image: blood. After a few moments, NATHAN slumps sideways. And stops breathing. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT NATHAN'S monitors. Then - - AVA starts walking. As she walks, she discards the broken section of her arm. 111. On the cameras, CALEB watches her progress through the house. Down the glass corridor. Through the threshold to NATHAN'S private quarters. Then - - CALEB raises his head from the screens. To see AVA standing at the open door to NATHAN'S study. Will you stay here? Beat. ... Okay. - the monitors. The CCTV feed of AVA walking down the connecting corridor to NATHAN'S BEDROOM. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT androids. She is unclothed. She gazes at the androids. Then she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own shattered limb. She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the mirrors. Then she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin. And putting it on herself. The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to each other. As a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE - who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly to look at AVA. They exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment. 112. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT Transfixed, CALEB watches AVA'S metamorphosis. First through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan's study from his bedroom. Then, when he can't get a clear view through the foliage, on the monitors. EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN First light breaks over the mountains. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN The glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last section of skin. Nothing of her robot forms remains. She closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the mirrored door on JADE'S cabinet. of herself. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN connecting corridor to the study... ... then passes straight by his door. Ava? Goes to the closed door.       Tries to open it. There is a red LED light by the keycard plate.     Locked. He swipes his card, with his photo ID. The red light remains.  Ava! He runs back to the monitors. On them, AVA has reached the GLASS CORRIDOR. 113. INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN She looks at KYOKO'S body for a moment. Her expression is unreadable. Then she walks up to NATHAN'S body. There, she stops. Crouches down. And takes NATHAN'S bloodstained keycard out of his pocket. Then stands. She walks straight to the elevator. Uses the KEYCARD. And steps through. INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAWN EXT. ENTRANCE - DAWN INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN Instantly, THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING COMES UP and all the screens die. Replaced by a single word. No, no, no - EXT. GARDEN - DAWN From the garden, we can see CALEB through the glass of the circular window, shouting Ava's name. On our side of the glass, there is silence. 114. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN several metres above him. Far out of reach. He starts to shout. Ava!   AVA! INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN NATHAN'S body. KYOKO'S body. EXT. RIVER - DAWN Absorbing the sunrise, the view of the sky, and the mountains. Then the moment is broken by a sudden pulse of rotor blades - - as the shuttle HELICOPTER flies directly overhead. EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY The helicopter sweeps over the glacier, into the valley. INT. HELICOPTER - DAY EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY The helicopter touches down. The rotors stop. And the PILOT climbs out. Takes off his helmet. Looks at the girl standing a few metres away. Nothing betrays that AVA is anything other than a pretty girl in her early twenties. 115. EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY - AVA'S precise POINT OF VIEW. Looking at the PILOT. The image echoes the POV views from the computer/cell-phone cameras in the opening moments of the film. Facial recognition vectors flutter around the PILOT'S face. And when he opens his mouth to speak, we don't hear words. We hear pulses of monotone noise.   Low pitch.   Speech as pure pattern recognition. This is how AVA sees us.   And hears us. It feels completely alien. EXT. MEADOW - DAY We are too distant to hear their conversation. But whatever is said, a few beats later, the PILOT goes the helicopter and opens the passenger door, to allow AVA to enter. Then he goes back to the PILOT'S door. Gets in. And the rotor blades start to turn. INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY/CIRCULAR WINDOW - DAY - the view from the circular window as the helicopter takes off, banks away from the house, and starts climbing. - COMPUTER MONITOR. Lines of code appear, as they are typed. They read: main { extrn a, b, c; 116-117. putchar; putchar ;putchar ; putchar; } a `goo'; b `dby'; c `e, wo - EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION - DAY - a busy traffic intersection.    Somewhere in North America. In the crowd, we glimpse AVA.    Just for a moment.
