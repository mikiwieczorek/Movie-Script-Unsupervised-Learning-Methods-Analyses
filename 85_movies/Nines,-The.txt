Written by John August November 2006 1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel 2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra 3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary A MAN'S HAND unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments. Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left wrist. A loop. A bracelet. We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break easily. There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds CHIRPING. Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage. A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS, revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks. merely a TV star.) Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running. Gary spots what he was looking for. EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR  Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is broken, SCRAPING against the deck. WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city. He couldn't fucking care less. He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon. 2. He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot. He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really empty. Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And spraying. We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket. On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet. through these MAIN TITLES. In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end. Just as it's about to reach its target, we... A DIGITAL METER shoots to 100 miles per gallon.   It's the display of Gary's Prius. We are... INT. THE PRIUS - DAY Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well. Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away. 3. low wall. He calls out to them: Hey!   Do you sell crack? The boys look wary. It's cool.     I'm only a cop on TV. Money changes hands. Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do with its lumpy beige contents. HOLLYWOOD. Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A matronly black streetwalker  approaches the passenger window. Gary holds up the little bag. Is this crack? She takes a closer look. Do you know how to do it? INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while. Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still laughing. LATER, Octavia is sleeping. 4. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY Gary takes a shower with his jeans on. INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but she's down for the count. Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing, he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers. Yes, hello. I'm having a medical situation. Yes. Okay. I don't have a belly button.  I do not have a belly button where I should, on my belly. And I'm concerned, because I don't know if that's... He sits down on the edge of the bed. Can a person live without a belly button? Because if you think about it, you're born with one. So if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. I guess I'm wondering: am I alive?  Or what if I'm God? A beat. No, no.   I'm totally sober. A beat. No, I don't think I need an ambulance. I don't seem to be dying any faster than usual. But I should probably go to the hospital, don't you think? Yeah, I should. He hangs up. 5. INT. THE PRIUS - DAY He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on trying to locate his missing navel. He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two sitting in the back seat.    All three Garys give each other thumbs-up. Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're UPSIDE-DOWN. Gary has rolled the car. The music suddenly STOPS.    We hear SIRENS approaching. Part One: INT. COURTHOUSE PROCESSING AREA - DAY La la la la la. Like you've never done worse. From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece. Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But it was an environmentally friendly car. Why doesn't that get reported? A beat. Please! He was heartbroken, betrayed. You say you understand but you don't. You can't. You're like a big giant Vulcan. 6. Noticing something to her right... He's coming. I'll call you later. She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.   We reveal being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand. Hi.    Margaret. I work for Lola. Gary. I know.  We need to go out the back. INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY Margaret leads the way.      She's been here before. Are there reporters out front? A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. "This bed is just right." I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty. What is? Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you. A phone RINGS. 7. INT. KITCHEN - DAY A designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher- ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING. Answer it. Gary picks it up. Hello?     Yes. Yes. He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at length. Then, very deliberately... The weather in Toledo is rainy. He says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger phrase. Use your normal voice.  Nine dogs ran through the field. The koala sits in the tree. The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet. It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off. What if I'm not here? Catching the officer's concerned look... That's why it's called house arrest. You stay inside your house.  He can take direction, I promise. 8. INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light. Gary wanders, checking it all out. Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable. I didn't mean to burn down my house. Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it.  This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto. Actor? Writer. So for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. I say, feel free to wear his clothes. He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. The gays. Noticing two crates... He has dogs? They're away at summer camp.    Now, try the bed. He lies back on it, feeling it out. It's fine. Comfortable? Sure. She massages his besocked feet. 9. Look, Gary, I know this has been crazy and stressful. I want you to feel safe. And comfortable. I do. I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your number-one fan. Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery. But if you fuck this up, I will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer. A long beat. That wouldn't be comfortable for either of us. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on the island. I'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you. I'm the only person who should be coming by. No buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers... I don't do heroin. Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable. Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off. Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone. 10. Let me see your phone. He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband box. C'mon!   All my numbers are in that. Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone. She picks up the liquor box, ready to go. You have my cell number. You have delivery menus. You're fine. Right? I guess. As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure. INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it. He plays a few NOTES on the piano. He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near the ocean. He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There isn't. He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room, which show the same thing in three different ways. EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself. He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet. 11. INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery menus. INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door. As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk. The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to being stared at. INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT Gary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate. He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating dinner. Once we get these samples back to the Crime Lab, we'll know who the real killer is. INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his lifetime. He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide. He lies back on the couch, reading it. He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting. A beat. to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as they go down on each other. Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't find anything. 12. INT. FOYER - NIGHT His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER We hear a THUNK.   Something hard was dropped on the wood floor. Gary hears it too. He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he reaches the two-story section of the foyer. That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal. We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway.   We can hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint PANTING. But there's no dog. the walkway, and can't see up into it. Is somebody there?   Hello? He CLAPS his hands twice.   Listens. Nothing. He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times before he ducks into the TV room to answer it. Hello?!  Yes. Yes. He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions on the phone. Nine leopards run through the jungle.  I bought two cakes at the store. His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up.   He looks back into the foyer. 13. The house is haunted. There's a zeitgeist, or something. EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK - DAY Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina. Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they were rats. L.A. is teaming with rats. They live in the palm trees. Sure.   Maybe. He's obviously not convinced. Okay. You know I'm a licensed psychotherapist. Really? No. I'm a publicist. My job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself. So pull your shit together. I am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade. Parade?   I fucking hate Parade. Everyone hates Parade. But the people who watch "Crime Lab," they love their Marilyn Vos Savant. Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven. Okay. One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons. He nods.   He gets it. 14. I swear to God, if you go batshit on me... I'm not crazy. Exactly.    Exactly. EXT. BACKYARD - DAY Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut.   Suddenly, a golf ball hits him on the head. He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond the wall that separates the properties. WOMAN'S VOICE Sorry!   Really sorry.  WOMAN'S VOICE  Over here. To your left.  Right. Sorry. Right. He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh- scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is. I'm working on my putting, if you can believe it. Indeed, she's holding a putter. Not really. Okay. Maybe I was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. You see, I'm under house arrest, too. What did you do? 15. I had sex with my husband. That's awful. Nine months later, I had Jaden. That's her over there. She's cute. She's sleeping for another...  ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to a schedule. She sounds really boring.  She is. You're rich. Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador? I'm Canadian.  Ohhh... I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself. Very Canadian. Thanks. 16. Listen, Jaden goes down again at 2:30. Maybe I could stop by. I'm pretty sure I'll be here. It's a date. Is it? She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house. Suddenly, she realizes... Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way. Gary. Yeah.    I know. INT. BATHROOM - DAY Gary brushes his teeth and tongue. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes. He plumps pillows. He looks up at the clock:      2:30. He sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets. He looks at the clock again:     2:49. EXT. BACK PATIO - DAY Under the pretense of sweeping up leaves, he peers over the wall, looking directly into Sarah's kitchen. But there's no one in there. 17. INT. UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - DAY Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few feet. He pokes one with a pencil.   The metal arm SNAPS back, breaking the pencil in two. INT. FOYER - DAY Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached to it. He turns it on. He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play. The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy Gary lies on the floor, listening to it.   He stares up at the elaborate chandelier. EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay. She stops beside him. The best of all possible worlds.  Okay.  Voltaire. Candide.  Are you actually reading it? I thought I was. He gets up. Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever. 18. Ah!   How boring of her. She hands him the wine. Housewarming gift. Demon liquor. The best part is, I can drink it. I pumped before I came. So did I. INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch. The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them. ... so it's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house. Yeah.   Fire's tricky that way. How about you? Any history of arson? Strangely enough... I knew it!     I could see that little spark. It wasn't arson.    Probably. A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him the story. Okay. When I was a little girl, our house caught on fire. 19. Oh shit. I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement. the same time. I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. And when it was all over, I said to myself, "Is that all there is to a fire?" Is that all there is? As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at all. It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is." Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. She leans closer. Let's break out the booze and have a ball. If that's all there is. Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for dancing. Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there is. 20. INT.   SARAH'S BATHROOM - DAY  Sarah leans up to the mirror, trying to get her contacts in. It's not going well. Her eyes are tearing up. Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love. Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die. But I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself, "Is that all there is to love?" INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY Sarah and Gary start to dance. Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep... INT. ANTIQUE HARDWARE STORE - DAY Deep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by vintage lighting fixtures. She's  trying to match a specific light switch plate. I know what you're thinking. If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment. I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself... INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY Sarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though her voice continues. 21. SARAH'S VOICE Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there... Just as they're about to kiss, A BABY HOWLS. It's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries to close the gap, but she's already standing up. I need to... Just... My shoes.     Are here.     Okay. As she reaches for one, she knocks over a wine glass. Crap! Don't worry about it.         Just... I'm going.     Bye. Carrying both her shoes, she's across the room and out the front door before he can say anything more. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the cabinet. Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle. He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the recycling. 22. INT. OFFICE / GYM - SUMMER NIGHT Gary works out hard on the elliptical trainer.    He has his iPod cranked with a POUNDING TUNE. He does abs on a stability ball.   He's spent. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads: Look for the Nines. He picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.    Sticks it back down on the counter. INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Gary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to the baby monitor: Sarah is singing a LULLABY. He takes off his shoes and socks. When she's finished... Goodnight, sweetheart. Goodnight. For a long beat, it's quiet.   Then we hear RUSTLING. A crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital voice speaks: The cat says meow! The pig says oink! Gary smiles to himself. The cow says moo! The cow says moo! The cow says moo! Evidently, Jaden loves the cow. The dog says, nine. Nine. Nine. Nine. 23. Gary looks back.     Did he just hear that? The phone RINGS. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT  Gary answers it on the third ring. Hello. It's the parole system. Yes. Yes. Two trains run through the forest. Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression. He nearly drops the phone. Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right. Nine.    Nine. Nine. Nine. Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air. Gary bolts for the door. Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off. He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main floor, rather than the second-floor walkway. Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out through the open door. EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit signage. 24. Jesus!   You scared the shit out of...  What?  You're hurt. I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I don't... I'm fine.    I'll be fine. Where are your parents? Your mom, your dad. Where are they?  Mom is at the car. Where you left her. 25.  You're lost. Look, you need to go back, okay? You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. Noelle glances to her left. We hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the curb. Shit. We go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car. Gary looks back. Noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have disappeared. Putting on his best face for the police... Evening, officers. INT./EXT.   POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT Handcuffed, Gary is placed in back.     He's reserving the right to remain silent. Once again, the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house. INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY The same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also features bandaged toes. Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station... She points to an electronic device by the wall. 26. ...the cops come, they throw your ass in jail. If you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your ass in jail. And if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system... ...the cops come and throw my ass in jail. No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail. The parole officer smiles. Do I still have to answer the phone? No, I'll be doing that from now on. I'm moving into the guest room. I don't need a babysitter. Despite all evidence to the contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool roomie. Who do you think taught Affleck how to gamble? The parole officer hits a test button on the anklet, which lets out a PIERCING ALARM. Let's never hear that again. EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY Margaret walks heel-to-toe, counting her steps. 97.   98.   99. With a piece of chalk, she draws a line on the concrete.    She looks back to Gary, who's waiting by the front door. 27. Behold! The edge of your world. In the world.  Out of the world. In the world. Out of the world. Look at me, I'm dancin'! She starts doing the running man over the line.   Even Gary's dark mood is broken. EXT. BACK PATIO - NIGHT Margaret and Gary roast marshmallows over the propane grill to make s'mores. They're giggling. So the guy was like, "Do you know fencing?" And I say, of course. That's what it says on my headshot. Lies! Always.   So he says, "Foil or epi?" Epée. I say, I'm about equal in both. Which is true. So he tosses me this fucking Conan sword and goes after me. I'm just swinging, trying to stay alive. But I end up cutting his ear. You cut his ear off? Just a little. But I got the job. Margaret is confused. 28. Wait. You were in Pirates of the Caribbean? Yes. No. Not the movie, the ride. I was like, "Gar! Keep both hands inside the boat!" Margaret laughs so hard she coughs. INT. UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT Ready for bed, Margaret leans out the guest bedroom door. Goodnight, fuckface. Gary looks out his door. Goodnight, you filthy whore. Both doors shut. EXT. HOUSE - DAY Establishing. It's incredible. EXT. BACK PATIO - DAY Margaret and Gary sip their morning beverages, looking at something spectacular in the yard. It's incredible. I know. Whenever I see them, and I always feel like, damn... ...I was born at the wrong time. Exactly. 29. We REVERSE to see the object of their awe: a giant inflatable jump-o-rama in the shape of a castle. INT. THE CASTLE - DAY bouncing off the walls, SCREAMING all the time. When both finally collapse, it becomes strangely tranquil. They're safe inside an inflatable paradise. Gary scoots over beside Margaret.     She puts her head on his arms. It's nice. Prelap:   A doorbell RINGS. INT.   FOYER - DAY Gary opens the door to find Sarah. Where's the warden? Groceries. Quite the little missus. She walks past him, into the house. INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY  Sarah crosses to the couch, picking up the baby monitor. How's Jaden? Boring. We haven't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having. There's an edge to her voice. You've been watching. 30. Well. I don't want to meddle in your affairs. My affairs? Everyone needs affection.    I get it. She's headed back for the door. I don't.    Are you seriously jealous? The opposite. I just want to protect her. From what? From you. Look at you. You date models. Actresses. Tennis players. Yeah. On a scale of one to ten, you belong with the Nines. We both know you won't settle for less. With that, she's gone. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Gary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher, but has a hard time getting one bowl to fit. What are "the Nines?" What? He looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by the phone. 31. "Look for the Nines." It's not mine. It's your handwriting. I didn't write it. Okay. She puts it back down.    But she doesn't believe him. All-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.  What? Nothing. Seriously, what? Nothing. I thought you were...forget it. Done.    Sorry. EXT. BACK YARD - DAY At the far edge of the property, Margaret and Gary play backgammon. Their mood is significantly more subdued. Margaret answers her RINGING cell phone. Yhello? Hi. What?!  I have to take this. He nods.   Margaret starts walking back to the house.  Well, who thought it was a good idea letting Courtney into a pottery shop? 32. Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5. Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5. He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn. EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps, only to find... MARGARET, who doesn't look pleased. I know who you are. Really. I know what you are. And if you come near him again... You'll what? Margaret lets that go unanswered.   There's obviously something big we're not privy to. What are you going to do, M... She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it. Sorry, what's he calling you? Margaret. I like that. "Margaret."   Classic. Why can't you just leave him alone? Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's watching him, he doesn't really exist.  And for the record, I'm not the one deceiving him.  33. He's going to figure it out eventually. And when he does, who do you think he's gonna blame? Sarah lets her warning land, then walks past Margaret, heading back down the stairs. INT. FOYER - DAY Gary heard the whole conversation.   Or at least enough of it to be deeply freaked out. INT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT Margaret leans out her doorway: Goodnight, ratface. Goodnight. INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT Gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking, but the wheels are turning. EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts circling things with a red Sharpie. it appears. As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper. Hey neighbor. Hi. 34. Sorry for the psychotic episode. I'll blame it on hormones. Okay. Are you alright? You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish. How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically? Probablistically?  You know what I mean. One time out of ten. How about every time? But they only show up when you look for them. Looking for them changes things. Some of these are prices. There's going to be a lot of nines when... There is something wrong with the world. You have an eyelash on your... here... 35. I can get you out of here.    But you have to trust me. Morning. enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning near the bars of the trellis. Everything okay? Peachy. Peachy's good. I like peaches. WIDER, we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of Margaret's line of sight. You want coffee? Sure. She turns and heads back into the house.    Once she's out of earshot... What do I do? You have to trust me. INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY  room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector. Gary stares up at it, intently.    He steps forward. A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector. Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough that the light never engages. 36. You okay? No. Oh. Tell me about the Nines. The Nines? The Nines. Sort of hard to start there... Try. And don't tell me I'm imagining it. They're showing up everywhere, and I want to know why. Best guess? They're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are. I'm a Nine? Yes. It doesn't make a lot of sense of out context.  Coffee? Why don't you drink coffee?   You're always drinking tea. 37. Happy? You're not going to understand this yet, but we've known each other for like 25 years. One day when I was 12, you called me out of the blue. And we've been talking ever since. Talking. On the phone. Usually. I never met you before I came here. You, Gary, never met me. But you're not always...  I can understand why you're a little confused. No.   I'm a lot confused. Theories? This is all a dream. No. I'm in a coma.  No. Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something. Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be. 38.  What does that mean? She sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back. Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. Gary gets up, headed for the front door. God, no!   Please, Gary, don't. But he's already outside. EXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed for Sarah's house. Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the tension. Margaret calls out from the arched windows. You don't know what you're doing. She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk line. What happens if I cross this line? The tear in her eye falls. I don't know. But it's not good. He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin to say, is that all there is? But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence- activated DRONE. Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about to happen. 39. Oh shit. 40. 41. Part Two: We RUSH IN on a television set, which spins around revealing a blinding constellation of pixels. Previously, on "Behind the Screen." EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY over his shoulder. He has a tidy, Banana Republic sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule. Gavin Taylor's one of the best TV writers out there. INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY Cluttered and corporate, with stacks of scripts and a few touches of arbitrary quirk. SUSAN HOWARD  and Gavin kiss hello. Every network would kill to work with him. INT. GAVIN'S OFFICE / GUESTHOUSE - DAY INTERVIEW. "Knowing" is a one-hour drama about a woman whose husband disappears. She starts to believe that her daughter is the key to a dark conspiracy. 42. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Gavin pitches his show to the NETWORK BOSSES. Basically, it's like "Rosemary's Toddler." EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY Impromptu INTERVIEW.    Gavin is beaming. We sold it in the room. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Gavin leans into the speakerphone. Just tell me Roger liked the script. INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY Susan is on her speakerphone. You're shooting a pilot. INT. SUSINA COFFEESHOP - DAY Gavin has coffee with actress MELISSA McCARTHY , his best friend. He's pitching her the idea. Melissa McCarthy is my first and only choice for the lead. I love it.     I'll do it. EXT. FOREST - DAY An EPK-style INTERVIEW, on the set of the pilot. Gavin and I have been friends for forever. 43. EXT. WARNER BROS. LOT - DAY Melissa hangs out with her "Gilmore Girls" CAST and CREW. It's really hard to leave a show like "Gilmore Girls," but I really believe in Gavin. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Gavin, Susan and a LINE PRODUCER go over the figures. The only way we can afford to shoot the pilot is in Canada. INT. BEDROOM - DAY Gavin stacks up clothes on his bed, preparing to pack. It's really hard to think about leaving for six weeks. EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY Gavin YELLS: Action! A STEADICAM follows Melissa as she gets out the passenger door of a Toyota Prius, an alarmed look on her face. INT.   LAX / BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY A DRIVER holds up a sign for "TAYLOR." Gavin approaches, waves to him. He has a laptop bag over his shoulder. 44. Gavin Taylor Creator / Showrunner INT.   LAUNDRY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY Gavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. same house from Part One.) We hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin kneels down to greet... Puggies! Gavin's PUGS pounce all over him. INT.   KITCHEN - DAY  Gavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he sorts through massive piles of mail. On his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet Gary wore in Part One. It's weird being back. It doesn't feel like my house anymore. INT.   FOYER - DAY Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie. At this stage, you have the script you wrote, and the film you shot, but you don't know how it's all going to come together. You just know how you want it to feel. He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the Disclavier unit. INT. EDITING SUITE - DAY Susan, Gavin and the EDITOR watch the cut.   Susan is taking notes on a legal pad. Susan flips to her next note.   TITLES list her position as: 45. Susan Howard VP, Drama Development I just don't know if you need the cold open. People want to get right to the story. INT. HALLWAY - DAY  Impromptu INTERVIEW. I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste. Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment? Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic. More importantly, I trust her as a barometer of Roger's taste. I know. But that's Roger's big thing this season. Never let the audience be confused. INT. EDITING SUITE -  DAY The Editor hands Melissa a microphone.    TITLES list her simply as: Melissa McCarthy "Mary" So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle. The monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a eight year-old actress  in a car. 46. What's the line?  How could you... Howkajew? Yeah. Howkajew. It sounds like kosher drug paraphernalia. Like, come on Shmuley! Have a toke on the Howkajew. I know. It's just for the test screening. They really think people won't get it? The dumb people might not. I didn't think we were making the show for dumb people. Howkajew...  How could you...  How couldjew... 47. I feel so dirty. That's how I like ya. Melissa giggles. INT.    TESTING SERVICE THEATRE - DAY A MODERATOR explains how it all works to the RECRUITED AUDIENCE. The test begins. a forest road. INT.    TESTING SERVICE / FOCUS GROUP ROOM - DAY Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot they just watched. Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a notepad, as always. One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin.  That guy's looking at me. He can't see you. As a test, Gavin waves his arm. The Agitated Man's expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's in reaction or not. The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man. How about you? Did you feel it was... It's not real. And what do you mean by that? 48. The show's not real. Why can't you see that? Jesus! Are you fucking blind?  You think you're above it all, don't you? You are trapped here with the rest of them, brother. He stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up to the one-way glass. He stares directly at Gavin, even though he shouldn't be able to see him. He SHOUTS: Get out.   Get out! Oblivio accebit! Gavin backs away from the glass, freaked out. EXT. STREET -  DAY Impromptu INTERVIEW with Gavin, standing beside his Prius. He's clearly still shaken by the experience. The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him. Gavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself. PRODUCER'S VOICE  What did he say? Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. "Oblivion approaches." PRODUCER'S VOICE  What do you think it means? Other than the world is coming to an end? "Oblivio" also means forgetting, forgetfulness.  I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it. 49. INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Gavin hosts a game night: good friends and lots of cocktails. The guests include Melissa and Susan, along with SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. don't show anyone's names.) They're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Between rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack for it. Susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay. Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet? From the screening? Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka. Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink. She makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS: Woman, where's my cocktail!  I'm a-comin!  I still love you most. She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink.  People write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. They get more specific. He SHAKES the mixer. Roger has this advice I always remember.  50. Forget about anyone who scores you in the Twos and Threes. They'll never like your show. Gavin pours. Instead, look for the Nines. The Nines. They're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. They get your vision. They just want it to be even better. Melissa YELLS from the living room: Round two is starting without you! So you'll look at the cards? Absolutely. Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note. As he leaves, we go in CLOSE to read it: INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY INTERVIEW. Sometimes the numbers point things out that you don't want to admit to yourself. In this case, Melissa. INSERT:   Comment cards. 51. Her overall scores were okay. But if you look at the people who scored the show highest, the one consistent dip was Melissa. INT. RESTAURANT - DAY Susan and Gavin are having lunch. She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. There's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of Melissa- time. True. That's one of the challenges with a premise pilot. But the network still likes the show? Of course. Roger is your biggest cheerleader. How about above Roger? Roger calls the shots. After he consults with the Higher Powers. True. Do they like the show? They haven't seen it. They're watching all the pilots on Friday. A beat. Why are you focusing on Melissa? 52. Because she's the biggest concern. She's also the biggest star in the show. No, you're the biggest star. Roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting Melissa when that wasn't his instinct. Well, hooray for Roger. I don't understand what you want me to do. Meet with someone. Who? Dahlia Salem. The network has a holding deal with her. Yes. And you put her in Gatin's pilot. It's dead. It's dying. But the network loves Dahlia. So if she could jump over to your show... Replace Melissa and reshoot the pilot. Roger would pay for it. So is this even about Melissa? 53. It's about getting your show on the air. That's all that matters in the end. EXT. SUSINA COFFEESHOP - DAY Establishing. INT. SUSINA COFFEESHOP - DAY Gavin meets with Dahlia Salem. She's pretty, funny, and very cool. They talk about the other pilot , the role, and how fucked up it is to be having these double-top-secret conversations. It goes well. They seem to genuinely like each other. INT. SUSINA - DAY  Dahlia is gone.           INTERVIEW with Gavin. I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role.  Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work. INT. PC BANG - NIGHT A empty storefront in Koreatown, both walls lined with computers for the CUSTOMERS playing high-end videogames.                                 We see Gavin playing. His INTERVIEW is intercut with his intense focus on the screen as he plays "Bad Day L.A." When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown.   54. Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button. INT. KITCHEN - DAY Gavin's on the phone. If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger. INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY Susan talks to the speakerphone. Roger's on a flight to London. But I talked with him before he left. He said yes on Dahlia. What does that mean? It means yes. Yes, replace Melissa? He wants your show on the air, starring Dahlia. I just got off the phone with her agents. They love it. She loves you. What about Melissa? You want me to call her agents? God no.    I'll tell her. Gavin hangs up.   We stay on his side of the conversation. In the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open by itself. 55. A beat later, it SLAMS shut. Gavin is understandably startled. INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY Melissa, wearing a nun's habit, sings "As Long As He Needs Me." A PIANIST is rehearsing with her. As long as he needs me, I know where I must be... In-between the pilot and the series, I'm trying to squeeze in a one-woman show.  I've always been obsessed with nuns. They're sort of like God's fag-hags. Melissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song to him. EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT Gavin and Melissa have martinis. I think my house is haunted. Your house is really old. 1926. Ever since I got back, I feel like there's someone else there. And then last night, I thought I heard something. A woman singing. Shit.   Like a ghost? 56. I guess. And then I saw something. I ran into someone. The woman? It was a man. I think it was me. Your house is haunted by yourself? Yeah. Gavin, are you alright? No.    No. The network wants to replace you. Oh my God. And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can. I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. So it's done. Finished.   Decided. Yes. 57. I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing. Don't get me wrong. I think you do feel bad for me. But that's all you feel for me. You still see me as the fat girl you call on Friday night when a date falls through. Let's go to a movie! Let's go to Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece of ass, don't worry about Melissa, you can apologize tomorrow. Or don't! Same difference. It's not like we're actually friends. I don't want to do this on camera. No, because you can't control it. Your little puppets are off their strings, running around. Saying things you didn't write. Reality terrifies you. Reality. Yes. The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that. God, thank you. Thank you for finally playing that card. I always knew you were holding onto it, the "I invented Melissa McCarthy card." Congratulations, you win. The game is over. 58. Don't you ever pity me again. She leaves him sitting at the table. INT. NETWORK CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY New MUSIC for a change of mood:     upbeat, excited. INTERVIEW: Upfronts is the week each year when the networks present their fall schedule to advertisers. INT. GAVIN'S OFFICE - DAY INTERVIEW: Sort of like, "Here's our new shit. Like it?"  Upfronts is a complete oxymoron, because no one is remotely honest. The schedule is a secret until it's announced, so everything is still in play. But hey!   At least you're in New York! INT. TOWNCAR / NEW YORK / DRIVING - DAY Gavin watches Manhattan roll by out the windows. 59. EXT. MANHATTAN HOTEL - DAY Gavin tips the DRIVER and wheels his luggage into a skyscraper hotel. INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY Gavin opens the door to room 1909. INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL ROOM - DAY Gavin checks out the view.     We go CLOSE ON a card which reads: Congrats! Love Roger, Susan, and everyone at the network It came with a fruit tray. INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY Gavin, alone, is headed down to the lobby.      Impromptu It's surreal being here. None of this is how I planned it. The elevator stops at another floor. CAMERA doesn't look as the doors open, but Gavin spots someone he knows. Hey you! WOMAN'S VOICE God.    Hi.    Gavin. elevator. You're doing your...show. She means the camera filming them. Get on. Come join reality television. She steps on.    Hits the button for "Lobby." When did you get in? 60. Just now. This whole last 24 hours has been surreal. I just said surreal. You're good? I wanted to call you. Please.   Call anytime.   I don't sleep. I just felt weird about what happened. Not sure he's following... Did something happen? EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY Near the hotel, Gavin is on his cell phone. So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem, star of my show... ... who tells me Gatin's show got picked up, so no, she won't be in my show, which makes me wonder, does my show even exist? As he listens to the other side, we hear a distant BOOM, and then a RUSH, like autumn leaves blowing down a street. Gavin reacts, though none of the PASSERSBY seem to hear it. Back to the conversation... No, I've left word with Roger. I've left word with Susan. It's like they've dropped off the face of the Earth. 61. INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL SUITE - DAY Susan is on her phone. At the same time, she's plowing through email on her Blackberry. Right now, the whole schedule's in flux. You get these missives from Roger and the Higher Powers... INTERVIEW: ...but you're not sure what they add up to. Right now, I can't say for certain whether Knowing will end up on the schedule at all. INT. HOTEL GYM - DAY Gavin talks with JOHN GATINS , who's doing abs on an exercise ball. John Gatins Creator/Showrunner "Paradise Fields" Look,   I'm sorry. But I'm kind of not.    I want my show on the air. And I   think it was shitty for you to go   after Dahlia behind my back. I heard your show was gone. I "heard" you fired Melissa McCarthy without having a backup. Why would they pick up your show when you don't have a star? The network wanted Dahlia. Yeah, in my show. We tested right before you. Our numbers were through the roof. Really. 62. Really.   Who's your exec? Susan Howard. She would know. She was there. Ask her. INT. CONFERENCE HALLWAY - DAY Susan is on her cell phone. A cocktail party is in full swing nearby. We can hear the DIN and MUSIC, and see the occasional GUEST looking for the restrooms.  I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did you   hear about Ricky's assistant? She   literally shat herself. No, I saw   it. In the background, we see Gavin approaching. Susan spots him and seizes up a bit. She holds up a one-sec finger to him as she continues her conversation. I will break your fucking finger.  I'll call you back. She hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each other to go first. Roger wanted to talk to you personally. Bullshit. They're only picking up two dramas. The rest is, what, reality? You can go mid-season. 63. You can go to Hell. Wow. You think I deliberately sabotaged your show. Didn't you? G., I'm on your side. Trust me, I'm the only one who is trying to protect you. All I want to know is why. You want a motive? Yes. This isn't "Crime Lab."   No one got murdered. My show did. So tell me why. I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. Melissa. You had to give her up.  C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so easily. I didn't. 64. What, you're the victim? The big Creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? It was your choice. I didn't make you do anything. I mean, do you have any principles? Do you believe in anything but your own ego? Fuck you. Your dialogue used to be sharper. Maybe Gatins could do a polish. He suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops hard. Gavin takes a step back. Tasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile. Is that all there is? In the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow. Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open. She's not going to hit him. Do you feel like a man? Because I'll tell you a secret. She leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange intimacy between them.  You're not. She walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin. EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY We move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from the camera, but it keeps following him. He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light. Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA: Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over.  65. Done. Gone. I`m not going to be your fucking puppet. OFF-SCREEN VOICE Are you alright? I'm fine. Who were you talking to? Oh God. 66. We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing moment. A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading... Exit Now? Unsaved changes will be lost.            An arrow slides back and forth between to the two options. Finally it lands on `Exit.' A CLICK. INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY  We're continuing an earlier scene from the end of Part One. I can understand why you're a little confused. No.   I'm a lot confused. Theories? This is all a dream. No. I'm in a coma.  No. Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something. 67. Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be.  What does that mean? Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. Okay, then. Who am I? You're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. You created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. You, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. Avatars. Call you what you will. Are you saying I'm God? Technically, no. If God is a ten -- a theoretical ultimate, that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined -- you're more of a nine. So what are you? Humans are sevens. Monkeys are sixes. What are the eights? Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus, they control the weather. 68. What's important is that you, you're the big cheese. El Supremo. You could destroy the world with a single thought.  Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. So you understand, I would have told you earlier, but I didn't... Yeah. Okay. I understand. But I don't believe you. 69. Part Three: EXT. MEADOW - DAY In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while insects CLICK and WHIRR. In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way. It's a family: father GABRIEL , wife MARY  and daughter NOELLE . They're returning from a short day hike. Mary carries a small videocamera. Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path... Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead. Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her hands in sign language.  No.   You had ice cream at lunch. Noelle begs to differ.   More signing.  Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count. I'll make note. EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius. Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It won't lift. Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked. Did you hit it? Shouldn't have to. 70. I think we left the overhead light on. Shit. Noelle. Battery is dead. Least the starter is. How do we...? We call the service.     That's all we can do. It's just the little battery that's dead, right? The big one is probably fine. I guess. We can't jump it from one battery to the other? Cross-over somehow? Who did you marry?      MacGyver? 71. Are you getting a signal? No.    Do you? Yes!     One bar. We're okay. Daddy's calling people to help us. The minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away. Keep trying. Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But it will keep happening. Well, what do you want to do? I don't know. Maybe if you hold it up higher. 72. The problem is we're boxed in. It's a canyon. A beat. Where we turned off the main road, it was more open. And higher, too. That's at least a mile. I can run that. So...we stay here? You okay with that? I don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. Go. Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a better plan. Neither does. Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window. Daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. You take care of your mom, okay? Noelle nods. I'll be right back. Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the road. We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little. EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.    He keeps an easy pace. In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields. 73. He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger... EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY  Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal. By his reaction, it's still iffy. He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same. He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road. He decides to head off to the right, downhill. EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal. In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her: Excuse me!     Hi! Hello? She stops, turns. Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness- loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader Joe's in Venice. Excuse me.     Do you have a cell phone? No, I don't. There's no service up here.  Yeah, I'm finding that out. You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station. Okay... She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came. 74. You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car? It's dead.     That's why I need... Oh... Yeah. Are you headed back to your car now? If you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever... Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to rape you or kill you or anything. Of course, that's what Ted Bundy would say. Look, I'm a videogame designer.  My wife is an editor. My daughter is four. They're waiting back at the car, and I want to get some help before it gets dark. I can call somebody when I get to town. 75. I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night. Sierra backs away. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Just help me out here. No.   I can't. I'm sorry. Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and keeps walking. Why won't you trust me? She doesn't turn back, heading down the road. EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle, who's getting tired of her coloring book. Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request. Okay, but you have to be careful, understand? You have to use Big Girl hands. Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle has some trouble folding out the little screen, but eventually gets it open without any help from her mom. Do you want to see where we were today? Noelle nods. Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips past. 76. Okay, now hit play. This button. Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her father eating lunch by a waterfall.  There's you. And there's Daddy. You're a little movie star, huh? Noelle smiles.   Signs something. He'll be back soon. Don't you worry. EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he came. From behind him... Hey! He turns, finding her a ways back.   She approaches. Were you following me? Once I was sure you weren't following me. I'm sorry, it's just... You thought I was Ted Bundy. Kinda. My name's Gabriel.   Bundy. She smiles. Sierra. They shake. Weird that there's no cars.    At all. 77. Yeah. So, listen. I'm parked that way. She points off the road, through the forest. It's not that far. If you want, I'll give you a ride to town. Really? Yeah.   Make up some karma. Lead the way. She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a dark forest. EXT.   FOREST - DAY Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller, creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them. Okay, confession.    I kind of recognized you. Really? I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit. No. You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God. Not really. 78.  79. Then I was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space. You had an account? I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it. Sorry. You can make it up to me. EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing. She holds the other cell phone , which she turns on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal. Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES. Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further. Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio. MAN'S VOICE ...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between Gavin and Melissa from Part 2. So it's done. Finished. Decided. Yeah. Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still pacing with the cell phone. I understand. 80. You do? I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing. Noelle REWINDS further.    Blocky pixels RUSH PAST as we... EXT.   FOREST - DAY Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where she's headed, even though there's no real path. During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her right shoulder blade: IX. So you play a lot of characters at once? A couple.    Most people do. You're not most people. You created the world. You know all the secret codes. What, like `God mode'? That's what you call it? That's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. A game isn't fun unless there are rules. And you make the rules. Yes I do. I mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. Half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive.  81. They deliberately crash the world servers. They'd ruin everything just to prove they could. INT.   FOREST VALE - DAY Sarah offers Gary her water bottle, which he gladly takes. Out of nowhere... Do you think I'm pretty? She stops, turning to face him. What? Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely physical level. Sure. He drinks. That's a rave. Well, I don't know why you're asking. My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, "What I like about you is that you're not so hot that I'm afraid of losing you." So where's the orc now? He's dead. I spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of GHB. He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died. He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back. Remind me not to piss you off, Sarah. 82. Sierra. He's surprised.    He could have sworn her name was Sarah. Sorry. And what makes you think you haven't pissed me off already? She smiles, keeps walking. EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car. Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video camera. How are you doing, kiddo? Noelle doesn't look up. I was thinking we could all go to El Cholo for dinner. How would you feel about some blue corn enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy when he gets back? Without looking up... He's not coming back. Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea she just spoke her first words. We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary says: How could you... Mary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave. Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line: Howkajew. How could you. How could you.  83.  I feel so dirty. That's how I like ya. Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the video camera. But she's still holding it. She hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself. Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs, "Mommy?" Mary backs away. EXT.   FOREST VALE - DAY Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this: He's sweating a lot. Am I crazy, or is it getting hotter? Oh, you're crazy. She hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks. When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment, just long enough for him to turn away. He doesn't. She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he doesn't fight it, either. She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back. I have a wife. And a daughter. They're waiting for me. Where are they? 84. Back at the car. I mean, which direction? They're back... Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR. He nearly falls over. He manages to steady himself. Face it, G.: You don't know where they are. You don't know where you are. We've been walking in circles for an hour. Where's your car? There is no car. That was all a...  "pretense," I guess. An excuse to get you alone. Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down in front of him. Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the GHB. In the water. She holds up the water bottle. EXT.   FOREST - DAY Gabriel experienced the flashbacks.   He felt time move. What's happening? I'm sorry it had to come this, G. But it'll all be over soon. 85. You're trying to kill me. No! No. This isn't a murder. It's an intervention. Images to accompany previous dialogue... I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. You had to give her up. Melissa? I can you out of here.    But you have to trust me. Do you feel like a man?   You're not. EXT.   FOREST - DAY Gabriel dry-heaves.   Sierra rubs his shoulders. That's right. Just let it go.       Let it go. She's genuinely empathetic -- she doesn't enjoy his suffering. Why are you doing this? You did it to yourself.   Admitting that is the first step. She comes around to face him. And now we see they're not alone. Two other familiar faces approach: OCTAVIA. 86. They're Nines as well. You're a crack-head, G. The thing is, this planet, these people, they're your drug of choice. INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY One and Two. Gary/Gavin/Gabriel has one conversation with Sarah/Susan/Sierra, but it's broken up among previous scenes and locations, sometimes for just a line.] S. It's not that hard to make a universe. At first, you just checked in every once in a while. See how the Neanderthals were doing. Move some continents around. But then you got more into it. Starting playing a couple of characters of your own. Kings. Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon, you were playing 24/7. G. How long have I..? S. You've been gone for four thousand years. Not that time means the same for us, but... G. You came looking for me. S. That's what a girl does. G. Why now? EXT. STREET - DAY  Streetwalker Octavia leans in Gary's car window. Because you forgot who you were. 87. INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY  The Agitated Man leans up to the one-way glass. You forgot this wasn't real. INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY S. We couldn't just storm in on a fiery chariot. It's your universe. We had to play by your rules. We had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was. Don't get me wrong, this world is nice. It's cozy. But do you remember where you came from? A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful. G. It was warm. And white.    Like... INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY  The Agitated Man/Parole Officer attaches Gary's anklet. You can't describe it with human words. INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY  Octavia leans over Gary, who has fallen off the bed. You can't think it with human thoughts. INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY S. That's why you have to come back. Come back with us. With me. 88. EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY Mary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her. You could destroy the world with a single thought.  Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. EXT.   ROAD / PRIUS - DAY Mary is still watching the tape. She realizes Noelle isn't watching over her shoulder anymore. Mary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen. Noelle?    Noelle! EXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY Gabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved road meets the gravel road. Maybe if I just cut back, didn't get so involved... We both know that'll never work. Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. You have to quit cold-turkey. I can't. 89. You can. But I can't force you to leave. You have to want it. She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string bracelet around his wrist. She kisses him.   And then she's gone. Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his decision. EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY Panicking, Mary calls out for -- Noelle!   Noelle! She's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her... She's here. Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding his hand. I didn't forget you guys. Mary regards him as a familiar stranger, a beloved imposter. Everything okay? Absolutely. Let's go home. sequence. INT.   PRIUS - DAY Gabriel climbs into the driver's seat. Both Mary and Noelle watch with interest as he pushes the "START" button. The car Everyone fastens their seatbelts. 90. EXT.   FOREST ROAD - DAY The Prius drives down the gravel road. Mary tries to keep her eyes on the scenery, but they keep drifting over to Gabriel, trying to read what he's thinking. EXT.   CROSSROADS - DAY The Prius turns on to the paved road.   Headlights switch on. EXT.   HOUSE - NIGHT The metal gate at the top of the driveway swings open, EXT.   DRIVEWAY - NIGHT Gabriel lifts the sleeping Noelle out of the car. Carries her into the house. Mary shuts the door behind them. INT.   NOELLE'S ROOM - NIGHT Taking off her shoes, Gabriel tucks Noelle into bed.   Turns on a nightlight for her. INT.   MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT Gabriel brushes his teeth with an electric toothbrush while Mary reads a magazine on the toilet. INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT Gabriel switches off the light. He spoons Mary, who kisses his hand. On both Mary and Gabriel's faces, we see anxiety. Things left unsaid. INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT  Gabriel lies awake, staring at the ceiling. 91. INT.   STAIRWELL - NIGHT Gabriel's bare feet walk down the carpeted stairs. INT.   DINING ROOM - NIGHT Gabriel stares at the three paintings on the wall. INT.   KITCHEN / EXT.   BACK YARD - DAWN Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue sky. His eyes are red, tired. He hasn't slept at all. It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious BIRD CALL. Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas.   He knows she's there. Neither wants to speak. You need to go, don't you? No.   I can stay. How long? Forever? Every day, you'd know what you were missing. He smiles, a little. What happens? If you go. Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. Oblivio accebit. The end of everything. That's all? Both smile. That probably wouldn't happen. The basic structure of the universe should hold. I guess I'm just worried about the human factor. You guys kill each other a lot. 92. In fairness, that's usually in your name. Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it. I like this world. I like my life, here, with you and Noelle... But it's not real. I'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. On some level, it's all pretend. It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend... That's a little creepy. I wanted you close. In one version, I even told you. I warned you that some day they might come for me, and... ...You'd have to leave.   How many versions were there? Ninety.   This is the last one. Wow. I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's painless... Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough. 93. So. So. Guess you don't really need to pack anything. I'm good. You're great. It's been a pleasure. Likewise.    I love you. Love you, too. Ya big lug. You're my favorite. 94. EXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and skyscrapers seem unreal, like models. Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the end of the pier. We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness. We see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving with them. Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9. As we get closer and closer, we... A PALE EYE, opening.    We are... INT.     KITCHEN - MORNING Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are none. As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret, but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of them. We'll call her M. She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing. Empty. MAN'S VOICE  Honey, do we have nutmeg? M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes, reading from a recipe. M We should. Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination. Cinnamon, too. 95.  If I had a horse... I would name her Cinnamon. Really. And if I had another horse... Nutmeg? No, Flash. M Sweetie? M   This is going to sound really strange, but...what's my name? Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy. M Right.    Exactly. He's not coming back. But it's gonna be okay. He put the pieces together, it's like... M The best of all possible worlds. 96. Honey? Is it supposed to stick like this? M We should help him. 97. The following scene  is the conversation between S and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three. So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be intercutting the best of all these moments to create one sequence. INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS S. It's not that hard to make a universe.
