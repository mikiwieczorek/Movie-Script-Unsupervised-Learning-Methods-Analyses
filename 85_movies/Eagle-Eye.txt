Written by John Glenn & Travis Wright March 28, 2007 EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned scene of life in another part of the world... EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES: We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: We have system control. 3/28/07 2 CONTINUED: Activate laser mic. EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield -- INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens: Is it him? Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei. Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room: based on reliable Intel from the Brits. Sire they're pulling off the highway. We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery. If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.  Alright, stay with him... 3/28/07 3 CONTINUED: EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles -- Looks like a training camp. emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH - 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT. What is that, a weapons cache? Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated. shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body... SCROLLS: Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention. 3/28/07 4. CONTINUED: Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in -- "Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation. I have POTUS calling from Air Force One. . Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up: Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.' You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..." Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one. And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers. 3/28/07 5. CONTINUED:  I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue: Understood.  We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets: -- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the acquisition's good -- target -- EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE. The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his mother's... A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS: as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence... We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT." WHITEWASH: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds -- then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen: this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an adult and a child -- under his breath: damnit... 3/28/07 6. CONTINUED: You gotta make a choice. You gotta move-- -- I know. Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table. there. Dwarves?: Bullshit -- Bullshit? I just blocked your ass and attacked with  Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that -- -- read the oracle text, my friend. -- shit A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK: You know what would be great? If you guys took a longer break. That'd be awesome. Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry: .The collator's broken. Dude: no its not.  Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson: Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves. Power can come from anywhere -- tomorrow night I'll give you first roll and a bonus pack if y-- 3/28/07 7. CONTINUED:  I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I'm going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are, this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry. That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating. -- what? But she said the collator's broken. And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up: Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF: INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere." And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims: a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH: 3/28/07 8. CONTINUED: Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world... EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT." INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry. Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes?  -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him -- INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. 9. 3/28/07 CONTINUED: So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI  You are hungry, I am guessing. Oh, no, no. I couldn't --  Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI So where is girl? I don't see her? Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Like the others. Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up. Your -- I'm like your dog? MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly: why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse. RF ) 3/28/07 10. CONTINUED:  MRS. WIERZBOWSKI  As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big.  You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit: This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI  Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly: its my mother. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Is problem?  is problem. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain -- EXT. CHURCH - DAY Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi. Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally, from somewhere, strength. He walks forward. 3/28/07 11. INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him-- -- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken: It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's identical twin. Off the surreal moment... A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's: INT. APARTMENT - DAY old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores: Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride -- -- we're gonna be late, huh? -- absolutely not -- I turned it off, came over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the-- 3/28/07 12.

Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO: INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense-- we need to get a new car -- I like your car. We're gonna be late. The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out: No we're not: the bus. -- are you kidding? EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with STICKERS -- I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning -- and one at night, I know -- And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse: More bills? Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the 3/28/07 13 CONTINUED: OH, SHIT! STAY HERE! Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC-- As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her: I KNOW, I'M SORRY! PASSES) HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE! And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox -- You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING RACHEL: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab -- INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them -- Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!! WAIT!! Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles: MRS. MILLER Under the wire --  Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- MRS. MILLER -- of course, Barbara Miller.  You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her -- 3/28/07 14. CONTINUED: Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time -- I will, mom -- -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'--  He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- MRS. MILLER I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto -- You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more -- It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya.. Fun? What's that?  I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house. -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller: Call me! MRS. MILLER Your mom gonna be okay? It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA... 3/28/07 15. CONTINUED:  We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: "HASSAD DRY CLEANERS." Loads the trumpet inside as we: INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: you didn't know either? No idea. I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was... WOMAN.#1  I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him: when was the last time they saw him? Margaret said years... INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... 3/28/07 16. CONTINUED: It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment. Six months without a boo or a bah. Didn't realize it'd been that long. Your mom was worried. So where were you this time? Nowhere.  Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p- -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world. I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket: I want to give you some, uh... No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is... EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen. 3/28/07 17 CONTINUED: screen reads: "BALANCE: $750,000.00" What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100 bills-- -- whoa -- Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous-- -- two seconds, sorry -- Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring. Big date. So... fingers crossed. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs. Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry!

WIERZBOWSKI -- where do you get this? Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours -- For me? 3/28/07 18. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS: around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles him -- all the LCD says is: "ANSWER NOW." -- hello? A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy. WOMAN'S VOICE Look out your window. They're coming for you.  -- what? Who is this? WOMAN'S VOICE Jerry. You have to run. Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack- jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale. WOMAN'S VOICE Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes. Jesus Christ -- what's happening?! WOMAN'S VOICE Run, or you'll be captured and convicted -- go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE.

I understand you've had a tough day. it hasn't been ideal. Your brother worked for the State Department. This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to us, Jerry clearly knew...

Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley.  Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her. I swear to God, dude-- Don't "dude" me.

Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American, computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT, 20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket: He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up -- What about the brother? Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City. 23. 3/28/07 CONTINUED: That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying "coincidence?" So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule.  Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move: Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again.

Follow me and don't talk. INT. GAMMAGE & BURNHAM LAW OFFICES - WISCONSIN - NIGHT Rachel's doing paperwork at her desk. People leave. for the night. An attorney named MICHAEL approaches; warm, good- looking, by all standards, a catch. She doesn't look up. He's out of town. Yup. Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity for a second date. In theory. In theory -- but I gotta site-check this brief, courier's coming in,.,the morning. Didn't we have a good time? Remember that? Our first date? Back in the 40's? He's so agreeably genuine, she wants to let him down easy: I had a great. time, I told you that but I'm so busy and... Ooo.o, shit, the "so busy" speech -- stop -- not worthy of you. Or me. I'm patient, so... call me. When you're not busy. Kyle goes to college in nine years-- it should be somewhere around then. I would so wait a decade for you. Call me his sophomore year, I'll prove it. And with a smile he heads off. She watches him go -- dammit! really liking him in this moment. She watches longer than she should... then goes back to her work.

Jerry's knocked the window back -- opens the control booth door and enters, examines the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE." -- this thing's on auto-pilot or something. Which doesn't happen, these barges are operated, by people. He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks: D'youthink -- she could derail a train? Are you kidding me? She changed every traffic light! This woman's called me on other people's phones -- some dude who happened to be sitting next to me! His phone rang -- it was her! For me! She broke me out of maximum-security custod in a way I'm not even gonna tell you cause you won't believe it -- and you saw how she directed us away from the police, then lifted us outta the world and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge!

My son is on a train. She threatened to kill him if I don't do what she says. They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an instant. She has something to lose. You tell me -- how does someone do all this? When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle -- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone. -- you see what I mean? He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench; Hello?

The Store Owner watches him leave, then looks back down at the BOX. INT. RIVER SIDE - DAY A Coast Guard cutter floats beside the now-abandoned garbage barge. The BMW's been lifted ashore by a crane -- FORENSIC a WAITING CHOPPER in the background.

There are more cameras on that route than the Super BOWL-- Department of Transpo says there was a seven minute equipment failure -- Do NOT tell me their equipment was down! Do NOT! Sir, that's what they're telling me... From Northbrook to the 290?! What about the bogus fax from Justice, was that equipment failure too? -- No sir, there's gotta be someone on the inside. -- ya think?! 3/28/07 39.

People who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost art? I have Markey on that right now Morgan's PHONE IS RINGING -- he answers: Morgan. When? NO. You tell them hold that 'til I talk to Sanford -  terrorist at large in the.city,-- I'm going back to forensics.

Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper -- Nobody who works for me calls me sir. understand?! It's disingenuous -- might as well be calling me 'asshole.' As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed. EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers... Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then: So you're a twin.  Who works at a copy place. And she manages a clipped, judgemental  laugh. Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me. 3/28/07 40. CONTINUED: So this whole situation is obviously about him. Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about anything. Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department -- -- so what? -- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother-- Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108: Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not trying to insult his memory -- he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying -- I'm implying if not him... then why you? Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist.  What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't "manual-shift driver." 3/28/07 41. CONTINUED:  I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything. Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished: Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them. Are you Jerry Shaw? who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket -- -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she said. I'm done. The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY. -- dropped off what? Who are you? Take it -- He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between them. Then: what's it for? I don't know -- I don't care -- but I will not drive you. You take the van  I'm not listening to you any more! And the man turns to go, just walks away. -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know! 3/28/07 42 CONTINUED:  And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man WAIT!! And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round -- What do you know? -- let me go! -- who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL for her -- she answers: WOMAN'S VOICE Stop him now or he will die.  How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches: Let go of me! On Rachel: WOMAN'S VOICE Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man -- Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back: I cannot! I have a family!!! She's going to KILL YOU! 3/28/07 43.

And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING... Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away. Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each - other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror - Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly: You killed him... you killed that man... WOMAN'S VOICE It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry. she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders: -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go.

A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks: That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, "Rex" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying: Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger. What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it?  A song on a radio? A howling dog? No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce. 3/28/07 45 CONTINUED: Fine job. Thank you, sir.

Then what's with the qualified nod? I'm not allowed to nod? Not if you're iudging me.-- JERRY. Judging?! I'm just making conversation. You think I should have gone with him anyway. I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it. Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there? Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad? 3/28/07 49. CONTINUED:  As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --? Insightful? Intuitive?

I'm not kidding! :but I can tell you that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door. JESUS!--WHAT'RE YOU D--?'. Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut -- 3/28/07 50. CONTINUED:  You can't leave me! Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door Don't walk away!  I'm done. Please! You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin : Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear. I'm sorry? What'd you just say? I can't do this without you. You mean without the "man-child?" Rachel's reserves crumble. Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train--  -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her. No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again -- 3/28/07 51. CONTINUED:  Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van. EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene. Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared. No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's.  Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints. And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call: Agent Morgan!"  Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice. Inside?! You absolutely sure on that? Yes, s--  Yes I am. Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS -- Looks like a bone mic, military grade. 3/28/07 52. CONTINUED: Can't even get these things on the black market.  Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him: We'll be needing that for evidence! EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable... a Federal bank? Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box.  yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry: 3/28/07 53. CONTINUED: Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box. You gonna open it? Maybe it's not gonna be so bad. Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW." Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear: WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know: -- what?! -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering. Excellent. What now -- what are we? 3/28/07 54. CONTINUED:  -- they're coming--we're supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?!  -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! -- hey, I applaud your parenting skills -- take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS REACTS, going for his gun: Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly -- Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case. You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that. I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor: Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother. 3/28/07 55. CONTINUED:  Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it. impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle: "01:12:36. 01:12:35." -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?! WOMAN'S VOICE You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. Would you stop doing that?! WOMAN'S VOICE There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.  Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN-- 3/28/07 56 INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING -- How do I look? Like you got into a fight. Me? Like you lost one. walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. their weapons. Rachel tensing. Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm. Two jerseys and two hats, please -- Peyton or Vinatieri?  I don't know what that means -- Jerry...  Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT Put these on -- JER-- Do it! 3/28/07 57 CONTINUED: They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2.. 1: The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door -- Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game. Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry -- I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED." EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next --  Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders. Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID: Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I need to ask you a question, sir -- 3/28/07 58. CONTINUED: Not now, you can direct it to my office. It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not -- -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds. So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--? I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes -- You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS: Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him: My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO: 3/28/07 59. INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please -- Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back: No! 2 trot it.  Thanks, though. INT. PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner -- among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE. She's handed a NEW BADGE that reads: "TEMPORARY ACCESS." Ahead, an elevator door OPENS and we start CROSS CUTTING: INT. ELEVATOR - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS Jerry, Rachel, and the bellhop step in. The Hop hits "Penthouse." MUZAK. They travel up: So, where'd you two get hitched? Reno. Niagara Falls. Shit. Niagara Falls. Reno. Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO: INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B- 36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: 3/28/07 60. INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS 12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system. Standing there waiting is SCOTT BOWMAN, early thirties, hasn't seen daylight in a while: Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36. If you'll follow me? INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS The Bellhop dramatically opens the door -- Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the bed... Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand- count sheets. And if you're looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet. On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel: dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort... Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS. Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here? 3/28/07 61. CONTINUED: Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol... What're you doing? If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these! Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately. WOMAN'S VOICE Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR WOMAN'S VOICE  There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG: There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes... WOMAN'S VOICE The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance. Where are we going now? What the hell's in the briefcase? WOMAN'S VOICE Your only consideration at present is to deliver it before the timer expires. 3/28/07 62. CONTINUED:   BULLSHIT! This is crazy! You're a television set! You don't watch me, I watch you! I wanna know what the hell's going on!! WOMAN'S VOICE It would not be efficacious to reveal my intentions. -- "not be efficacious"?! Who the.fuck talks like that?! -- Jerry -- We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowâ¢.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US Nothing. Furious, he moves to.the WINDOW -- Fine, have it your way,.Lady -- I'm gonna scream bloody murder out this window 'til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and I'm gonna tell them everything even if they think I'm a crazy sonofabitch 'cause at least I won't have to listen to you any more! -- JERRY -- He YANKS the window up -- WOMAN'S VOICE STOP. He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then computer-controlled network. And now: assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE -- WOMAN'S VOICE  My name... is Aria. Rachel and Jerry stare -- what the hell is this? 3/26/07 63. INT. PENTAGON - MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal "THE TANK." A glassed-in wall containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The "brain" of a com uter network. The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV. Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water keeps her from overheating -- that's ninety-two thousand processors, the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together as:,.one..."'  an electronic espionage system. No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther. INT. HONEYMOON SUITE CONTINUOUS Jerry and Rachel gape as:MORE IMAGES flash: the RADIO DOMES, I was created by "DARPA": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other -- a computer?! INT. MAINFRAME TANK - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin  3/28/07 64. CONTINUED: Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out. THINKING) But what if -- -- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS Wait, you think we're a.threat? No. You're a means to an end. On TV, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP: Under National Security Directive 359, Sub-Section 72 -- "when units are needed for the national defense, civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service..." you're drafting us? The guy you killed in the desert -- last time I checked, murder wasn't legal. In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is... 3/28/07 65. CONTINUED: what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen: We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face.  No, he worked for the State Department..: Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman. What's the hell is a 'Horseman'? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four "Horsemen": Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died.  He was smarter than all of us put together. Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?" Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except... Except what? 3/28/07 66 CONTINUED: The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP: Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS Jerry sinks to the edge of the bed, runs hands: through his hair: To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple. Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying-- What's the task? To insure the national security of the United States. What d'you need me for then? That is not your concern right now. Are you kidding me? Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother. I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious: Your brother succeeded in everything he did.  3/28/07 67. CONTINUED: Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it -- You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow.  And because you've seen what happens to deserters. -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open. Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle -- The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat...  Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down: "01:08:43.. 01:08:42... 01:08:41..." 3/28/07 68. CONTINUED:  MAN'S VOICE Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office... EXT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY The bank's roped off and labelled "CRIME AREA." Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest: Biotech? The chemical company? When they make a new compound, they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials.  Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case? You'd have to ask -- could be` anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us. Tell you one thing, though... the guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches: We pulled video... nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl. There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! " 8 hidden no one can see! Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us. It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too. Tell everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task force without my say-so. 3/28/07 69. CONTINUED: I'm on it -- also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead -- Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside. Do not tell me that is what I think it is.  Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.-- INT. BATHROOM - FOUR SEASONS - DAY Rachel's face WHIPS UP INTO FRAME, her hair now DYED BLONDE. She stares at her reflection, trying to:process it all. . .when her cell RINGS: "KYLE." With a GASP she picks it up-- -- Kyle?! Hey, mom, it's. me. -- sweetie, where areou, are you -- But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL -- her heart SINKS: Got your message, the train's awesome -- Brian tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to "M." I'll call when we hit D.C. Bye, ma -- Rachel holding the phone like it's some kind of life-line to her son. When there's a strange BEEP then the voice of ARIA: Your son left that message sixty seconds ago. I'll do whatever you want -- don't hurt him, please -- I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother -- can you understand that? 3/28/07 70. CONTINUED: There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother.  Jesus... You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you first... EXT. BATHROOM - SAME Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks: Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do -- What? No way, I can't just -- -- when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds. Rachel? You in there? Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's VOICE,"mustering strength through the door: COMING) Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he's lagging... INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - DAY Latesha PACES THROUGH FRAME, nervously filing her nails with her watches, annoyed by the filing: 3/28/07 71. CONTINUED: I dunno, the whole thing's off somehow - but get this: B-36 isn't a security classification, it's a sub-level here at the Pentagon -- eyeing her) What? Girl's gotta groom. INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - DAY Morgan's on the other end, Grant and the Clerk run through a playback of the CCTV FEEDS looking out onto the street in front of 7-11. Good old-fashioned VCR.  -- you're shitting me INT. HALLWAY - B-36 SECTOR - CONTINUOUS Yeah, 36 floors underground -- and it gets weirder: LATESHA'S VOICE Four years ago, DARPA commissioned... ... .computer... ... Simms? You're breaking up -- Muttering "dainnit," she tries to call Morgan back. No dice. watching her. Unsettling. We read: "VOICE MIMEO ACTIVATED" INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS And though Latesha isn't speaking, WE START TO HEAR HER VOICE: LATESHA/ARIA  Sorry about that -- As we realize Aria's taken over the call by mimicking Latesha: LATESHA/ARIA   I'm getting a bad signal down here. 3/28/07 72. CONTINUED: I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' --? LATESHA/ARIA Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort Meade. Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds: Wait -- go back, freeze that - faces obscured. Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: "ICON LIMOUSINE SERVICES."  Find that car!  Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call. Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens: Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: "PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT." Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward.  Aria, go voice active, please. 3/26/07 73 CONTINUED: Hello, Scott. How may I assist you? It talks? I'm fluent in 6,800 languages, 41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues. Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task force. A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms. . Am I supposed to -- Um... what's up. SCOTT. Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building. Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera -- There's no feed from inside here? No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel. So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day. 3/28/07 74. CONTINUED:  Except three minutes early... Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera. Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP -- ARIA. OVER SPEAKER  I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze. Negative, I'm prioritizing this. I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED It's like he's trying to say something... A code. He's blinking code It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it --  Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS -- F...

Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. ." all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters: "F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. ." The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two "E's." Dividing words.. And GETS IT: EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall. Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing: It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras. :: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what they're doin Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something, anything... but finds NOTHING. I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans -- Maintenance replaced it yesterday.  This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes. 3/28/07 76. CONTINUED:  She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'? EXT. LIMO - DAY The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too-- something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start -- Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep? Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised. Wow, is that me? One of my only party tricks.  It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder... About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window... You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did.  Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up.  3/28/07 77. CONTINUED: I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too -- You're being too hard on yourself-- No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder. Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...  Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: "00:15:36...00:15:35..." You don't think -- -- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane -- -- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside. I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over anyway -- But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case. 3/28/07 78. CONTINUED:  Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it. INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with M-16's scan the crowd.

I've never done 'em in a cargo container. Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the walkie and TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first time, they're alone. He keeps her distracted: Tell me something -- -- what? -- anything -- something personal, something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me I don't know. : You're being sweet, but it's not working - -- where's you ex-husband? You didn't tell me before-- -- you're gonna distract me by bringing up my life's biggest mistake? -- how could it be your biggest mistake?

STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything. We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor Lady, you can't do that! The hell I can't! Come on! Shit.
