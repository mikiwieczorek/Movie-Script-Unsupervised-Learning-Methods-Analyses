He is sweating slightly in the summer heat. We hold for a moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen ceiling fan. his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead. States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington, Virginia. 1983. The General's assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his desk, working. After a moment Putkin seems to come to a decision.  Boone? Yes General? I'm going into the next office. Yes sir. The General stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps out from behind his desk and begins to walk. Boone watches, with some trepidation, as the General increases his pace. He quickens to a jog, his face set with determination. He breaks into a run... Then he slams into the WALL of the office, rebounds and lies splayed on the floor. He stares up at the wall balefully. Damn it! 2. 3   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                          3 General Putkin is being driven in a jeep through the vast military base. He has a band-aid over his injured nose. Bragg, North Carolina. I have been having ideas, gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And when I thought about these ideas I thought about who in the U.S Army would be most receptive to my challenging ideas. The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE. The General gets out, a brief case in his hand and surveys the centre.  Which section of the military is always straining to reach the peak of their physical and mental capabilities? 4   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                       4 General Putkin stands in front of a room full of seated You are, gentlemen. Special Forces. The assembled Officers nod modestly. I want to talk to you about Mind Wars, gentlemen. War...With... MINDS... His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a How'd you like to be able to do this? What if you could teach soldiers to do this? Would you be interested? Silence.  3. 4   CONTINUED:                                                 4  Or, or let's say you have a unit operating outside the protection of mainline units. What happens if someone gets hurt? How do you deal with that? He surveys the blank faces. Psychic healing! Protect the unit with hands-off healing. Using the mind to heal. Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience. Let's talk about time! What if time is not a point but a space and at any one instant we can be anywhere in that space!  Physicists go nuts when I say that! Silence. He is growing desperate. Animals! Stopping the hearts of animals! This is the idea I'm coming to you with. You have access to animals right? Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs. No sir. We don't have access to animals. 5   EXT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   5 A dejected General Putkin climbs back into his jeep. Lieutenant Boone, in the driving seat, looks at him with sympathy. In 1983, when Special Forces told General Putkin that they weren't interested in his ideas...that was a lie. 6   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   6 The BENT FORK sits on the table in the EXTREME FOREGROUND, a window in the background.  4. 6   CONTINUED:                                                  6 And when they told him they didn't have access to animals...that was also a lie. We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards an abandoned looking HOSPITAL BUILDING half hidden by trees. 7   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY                               7 We TRACK forward into the shadowy interior into a large space which we now see is full of...GOATS. The hundred goats in the disused hospital building had been secretly flown in from Central America so as to avoid customs. Special Forces weren't worried about the General hearing the goats because they'd been de- bleated. The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and closing. This is the story of those goats. We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT, then... 8   INT. LOCAL NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY                           8 Bob sits typing at his desk in the modest office. He wears glasses, is attractive in a fresh-faced, enthusiastic kind of way. SUPERED TITLES read: Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 2003. My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me back in Michigan, where I was born and raised. I studied journalism at Western in Kalamazoo and then I got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories about competitive food eating contests. He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk and up to where she stands, photocopying in DAVE the Editor's office. Dave is chatting to her. He has a  5. 8   CONTINUED:                                                   8  Look at me. So young. "The past is a different country. They...do things there." We PAN to the next desk and Bob's over-weight colleague RON, who sits eating a hot-dog. This is Ron. Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face- first into his desk. He's the man who died. 9   INT. OFFICE - LATER                                          9 Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into a box. My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron's death had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a memento mori. Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He touches it, fascinated. That massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness. Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in Dave's office. BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's, Bob frowns. A week after the funeral she left me for my editor. 6. 10   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 10 Bob and Debora and Dave talking. Bob is drinking. We JUMP him.  It seemed like such a tragedy at the time. We couldn't see beyond our little lives to the great events of history unfolding out there in the world. good arm. Debora is sitting, head in hands. I was like a child. Or a Hobbit, safe in the Shire. drunk, watching Bush's STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH on TV. Or a blonde farm boy on a distant, desert planet, unaware that he was already taking the first steps on the path that will lead him inexorably towards the heart of a conflict between the forces of Good and Evil.  Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves... Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen. Had I known where that path would lead, had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django, I might never have gone. But as it was, I did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart... I went to war. We hear the opening of a period song as we... 7. 11   TITLES                                                   11 As the titles and song continue we see U.S TV footage from the Iraq War - a dizzying MTV montage, war made pop- video. Shots include... ""Shock and Awe" air attack on Baghdad Caravans of U.S troops snaking through the desert Fighter plane video of an Iraqi fighter jet being destroyed on the ground Oil Wells ablaze words "Our hearts go with you". Apache Helicopter attacks and destroys an Iraqi tank. Soldiers plant an American flag with Iwo Jima-like American troops pull down a huge statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad. An American flag draped over the head is hastily replaced by an Iraqi flag. 12   INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY                                    12 Bob sits on the bed talking to Debora on the phone. Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy. concerned as Bob would like) Yeah. We've been watching it on Fox.  8. 12   CONTINUED:                                                12 Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen things that you shouldn't, you know... He shakes his head sadly. Pretty damn hairy. Well I don't even know why you're there. You're not exactly war correspondent material are you?  Well, I think it's important people get an accurate picture of what's...  What? Yeah.  ...what's, uh, happening, so...is that Dave? Yeah. He says Hi. Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might start to cry. Oh, that's, that's... He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment. Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out - heading up north to cover the fighting there... 13   EXT. KUWAIT CITY -    HOTEL - DAY                         13 Bob walks out and puts his sunglasses on, staring around the quiet POOL-SIDE area. He sighs, sits down on a a sunlounger, starts to read his book. TITLES READ "Kuwait City, Kuwait, Spring 2003." You missed the war? 9. 14   INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY                                  14 Bob is drinking coffee with two gung-ho type war correspondents. Yeah. They laugh. How?  I've been stuck here. They've only just given me the green-light. So I'll probably head over there soon. I'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build. The Journalists look bored. Yeah, I think they didn't want me going over because I'm not embedded. Yeah, they don't like the unilats. The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back. When you're you form a bond with the soldiers. You're like one of them. JOURNALIST) You see action? Went into Baghdad with Charlie Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division... The thunder run? Heard you had it pretty bad. Could say that. Technicals all the way, RPG's, fuckers were firing anti-aircraft guns at us...  10. 14   CONTINUED:                                                 14 You know a Private First Class Zuchero? Zook? I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories. 15   EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - NIGHT                                 15 Bob sits drinking more coffee.  So what's a useful phrase? La termi, ana sahafi. Bob repeats this. What's that mean? Don't shoot, I'm a reporter. He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his notebook. We see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of EYES. He notices a A MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP sitting at the next table.  Hey.  Hey. Bob reads the logo on the baseball cap. DeWitt Resources. Arkansas.  Right. We make trash cans. You over here for the conference? Looking for a contract right?  11. 15   CONTINUED:                                                  15 I guess. What's your pitch? The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN CASSADY. Well...we're real cheap. Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand. Bob Wilton.  Skip. Could I bum a smoke, Skip? Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously. I sat there watching those reporters and realized I didn't want to be me anymore. I wanted to be them. I wanted to face peril and stand witness to the fall and rise of nations. Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark. Everyone gets everything he wants. Like the man said. I wanted a mission. in the dark) Oh crap, can't find my... A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap. Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the CONFERENCE I.D Lyn has pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S. CASSADY.  12. 15   CONTINUED:                                            15 And for my sins, Fate brought me one. He stares at the name as he puffs on the cigarette, vaguely troubled by a memory.  Lyn Cassady...? 16   EXT. GUS LACEY'S HOUSE- MICHIGAN - DAY - THE PAST        16 Bob pulls up in a car outside. SUPERED TITLES READ: Monroe, Michigan, 1997 This is the home learning course we're putting out, which is very popular. 17   INT. GUS LACEY'S HOUSE - DAY                             17 Bob is interviewing Gus Lacey at Lacey's dining room table. Gus has a sun-bed tan and odd hair. His nervous looking MOTHER sits beside them. Gus is holding up a picture of Gus, reads "Free To Roam - Learn E.S.P from the master!" Then there's the seminars. When I'm not teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing. Right here? The kitchen table. That is correct. That's where my body is. But my mind...that's, you know... He gestures to the horizon. Wandering? Wandering. Roaming. Yeah. So what have you seen lately?  13. 17   CONTINUED:                                                 17 Lately I've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur. That's an exclusive for you. Okay. Wow. E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy. So...when did this all start for you Gus? It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say... Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile. I can't really talk about Bill. So what did you do in the army? We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work... He stops, his face darkening. We were trained to kill animals.  You mean, what...with your...? With our minds. That is correct. Just by staring at them.  14. 17   CONTINUED:                                             17  Huh. What kind of animals? One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat. Wow. I don't know what to say. The power they unlocked in us...  Last week I killed my hamster.  You wanna see? 18   BACK OFFICE - LATER                                       18 cage. Bob and Gus sit watching the TV. Gus' mother hovers in the background. You ever seen a hamster do that before? Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what... Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel. Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so... Good. Then they'll know how rare that is. Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down!  15. 18   CONTINUED:                                                18 Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over. Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters! No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start eating. TV) Bizarre. Right? Well...it didn't die. I thought you said you killed it?  Yeah well...Mother) Mother said no. She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal. She said "Don't show him the hamster dying. Show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead." Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and defiant at the same time. Gus stares at the blank TV, sips his coffee. This was nothing. You should have seen the Skipper at work. Who's the Skipper? Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force.  I think he runs a dance studio now.  16. 18   CONTINUED:                                            18 BOB'S NOTEBOOK - as he writes down the name LYN CASSADY... 19   EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - THE PRESENT - AS BEFORE             19 Bob straightens from lighting his cigarette, stares at Lyn. Do you...do you know a Gus Lacey? Beat. Lyn gets up and walks away. Lyn?  Skip?  Lyn? 20   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                      20 Bob hurries to catch up with Lyn. He follows him around a corner and skids to a halt. Lyn is facing him, standing on one leg, hands raised above his head in an odd martial arts stance. He emits a threatening croon. Bob raises his hands nervously. Whoa! You working for Hooper? Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram. How do you know about Lacey? I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show. Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head ruefully. Little prick...what'd he tell you? He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?                     17. 20   CONTINUED:                                                  20 And he said the Loch Ness Monster was the ghost of a dinosaur. Who's Bill Django? DISGUST) Did he show you his "Home Study Course"? Yes. CORRIDOR) Yeah I bet he did.  Are you...? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh...? Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot?  He is an idiot...or he was...he's dead now. He was a paranormal whore. Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We took an oath. We don't divulge... But you're saying there was a secret unit? Lyn stops, turns and stares at him. We...don't...divulge. 21   INT. LYN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                               21 Bob and Lyn are talking, passing a bottle of Scotch backwards and forwards between them. Both are drunk. Okay. Let me ask you something. What color were the chairs in the hotel bar?  Uh...?  18. 21   CONTINUED:                                                21 You were in there for hours. What color were the chairs? Um...brown? They were green. How many lights are there in this room? Bob starts to look around. A Super Soldier wouldn't need to look. He would just know. A Super Soldier? A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details.  What's a Jedi Warrior? You're looking at one. You're a Jedi Warrior? That's correct. What does that...? I don't think I...  I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired. In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi. The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers.   19. 21   CONTINUED:                                            21 Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the first generation of the New Earth Army.  You've got super powers? That's correct. Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode. Okay, so, so you're saying you were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey? We prefer the term Remote Viewer. How does that work? Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse... What about you? Lyn thinks about it. Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music. Yeah?  Like who? I like Boston. Boston usually works. Bob jots this down in the notebook.  What other powers did you practise?  20. 21   CONTINUED:                                          21 Invisibility.  Invisibility? Yup. That was Level Three. Actual invisibility? Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility. Bob tries to follow this. Like camouflage? It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise... Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND. Then you think black. That's the nothingness. Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting. I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff.  How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this? Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn. Not going to happen.  21. 21   CONTINUED:                                            21 No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and I... Not going to happen. All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and... I'm shipping out tomorrow. You're going home? Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim. Bob's face falls. Oh. They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring...  I could come.  What? I could come with you, maybe, and... Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and... No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and...  22. 21   CONTINUED:                                          21 It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you. Bob flushes with annoyance. Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand? He slaps his notebook for emphasis. A journalist. I go where the story is. I was an American. I was Resolute. I wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world. And to my wife. And to that one-armed cunt Dave. Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob and examines Bob's DRAWINGS OF EYES. What's this? What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE. What's the matter?  Nothing. He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He hands it to Bob. Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245. The New Earth Army Manual. Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and reads...  23. 21   CONTINUED:                                          21  The U.S Army doesn't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful! Bob looks at the DISCLAIMER at the bottom of the page. BOB   This does not represent the official position of the United States Army at this time. Bob looks up at Lyn who nods gravely. You wanted to know who Bill Django was?  He's the man who wrote that book. 22   EXT. EXPRESSWAY - IRAQ - MORNING                          22 Lyn's CAR roars down the expressway into Southern Iraq, passing A TANK which sits by the road-side. 23   I/E. CAR - MORNING                                        23 Lyn drives. A hung-over Bob sits reading the New Earth Army Manual.  The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather. The courage and nobility of the Warrior, blended with the spirituality of the Monk. 24   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                           24 The car passes oil fields, beyond the buildings thinning out into the desert. The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt Disney... 25   I/E. CAR - DAY                                            25 Bob is still reading.  24. 25   CONTINUED:                                                 25  The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide. Jedis will parachute into war zones, utilizing sparkly eyes technique, carrying symbolic flowers and animals, playing indigenous music and words of peace... INSERT: An illustration of a SOLDIER CARRYING A LAMB and some LILIES - with what appears to be some kind of loudspeaker strapped to his shoulder. What's the sparkly eyes technique? Lyn raises his shades and twinkles his eyes at Bob for a moment. Okay. You see it? I think so.  Lyn? Yeah? Who is this Bill Django? Lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully. I don't know where to begin. 26   EXT. VIETNAM - DAY - THE PAST                              26 all - trips out of a HOVERING HELICOPTER and falls, head- first down towards us. the camera. 27   INT. CAR - AS BEFORE                                       27 Lyn exhales smoke.  25. 27   CONTINUED:                                              27 Bill always said it started for him when he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam. 28   EXT. VIETNAM - DAY - THE PAST                             28 Bill hits the ground, which is luckily mainly composed of MUD. He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him and his PLATOON begin to debark. The Helicopters barely touch the ground before they take off again. SUPERED Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the barrel clogged with earth. He pokes his finger into the muzzle trying to clean it, then finds he can't get it back out again. Oh, man... He tries to pull his finger free, glances up and FREEZES. Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE, yelling wildly.  Knock-it off! Chris! Knock-it off! Bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him, his M- 16 hanging painfully from his other hand. Will you knock it off? to his feet) Jesus. What do you think...? THUNK. A SOLDIER standing next to Bill drops, the back of his head sprayed over nearby soldiers. SILENCE. Everyone stares at the dead man. Another shot rings out - another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the tree- line ahead of them.  meters! It's a woman! The WOMAN is jogging across the tree-line ahead, weapon in hand.  26. 28   CONTINUED:                                                  28 HAND) Okay! Silence. Long pause. Well!? What? What the fu...! Why isn't anyone firing? His men stare back at him, frightened. The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman keeps on running as the foliage above her head is shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches amazed. Every single one of Bill's men fired high. They instinctively hadn't wanted to shoot another person. Later Bill would come across a study by General S.L.A Marshall, which revealed that only 15-20 percent of fresh soldiers shot to kill. The rest aimed high, didn't fire at all, or pretended to be busy doing something else. Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE. Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud, his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there, staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement, as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest. BILL'S P.O.V - the edges of our vision darken down as the sound FADES OUT.

MILITARY HOSPITAL - THE PAST - DAY                   29 Bill lies in his bed, staring sadly at the other casualties in the ward - amputees, spinals, burns... Recovering in hospital, Bill wrote to General T.L Cornplow, Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, explaining that he wanted to go on a fact-finding mission to explore alternative combat tactics. The Pentagon agreed to pay his salary and expenses for the duration of the journey. We hear the opening of a period song as we... 30   EXT. HIGHWAY - THE PAST - DAY                             30 ...as the track continues we see Bill in civilian dress, driving down the Pacific Coast Highway. What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon was that he was really looking for the answer to the riddle of his vision. How could his men's gentleness, their general lack of interest in killing people, how could this be turned into a strength? How could love and peace help win wars? Bill knew where to go to find out. 31   EXT.

Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as Bill disappeared into the New Age Movement for six years. Bill feels Thompson staring at him. He smiles nervously. 38   EXT. FORT BRAGG - MAIN GATES - THE PAST - DAY               38 It's 1980. Bill walks down the road towards the entrance gates. His long hair is braided. He has an EYE painted on his forehead. Like all Shamen before him, he had traversed the wilderness. Now he was returning to his people, a changed man. The SENTRIES at the gate check Bill's PASS suspiciously. He brought with him his confidential report - The New Earth Army Manual. The Gates swing open and Bill passes through. 39   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                           39 Lyn crouches revolving a curious aluminium CONE towards the sun. Bob sits by the car, reading the manual. He looks up, watches Lyn.  Does it direct your powers?  30. 39   CONTINUED:                                                  39 What? The cone. Does it direct your psychic powers or something? No. What does it do? Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them into the cone. It cooks supper. He examines the stove approvingly. Solar. Utilizing the power of the universe - no pollution, totally renewable. This is like New Earth Army technology. Bob picks up the Manual and starts to read. Lyn watches him. Pretty mind-blowing, isn't it? First time I read it, I was like...what the fuck? Yes.  But... He stops. What? Nothing. Go on - what? Well it's just...it's hard to believe the Pentagon paid for this. I mean, it's very interesting, but there's nothing in here that's actually about...fighting?  31. 39   CONTINUED:                                             39 The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict. We're a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals. Non-lethals? Lyn flicks away his cigarette. Check this out. He takes a yellow PLASTIC BLOB from his pocket with a flourish. The Predator.  The Predator?  That's a plastic blob, Lyn. the blob) That's a... Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it. OH! OH FUCK! OH...FUCK! You see? You're mine now. The Predator is completely biodegradable. It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways. He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated edge down Bob's temple. OWWWWWW! It has warrior functions. And it looks a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology. Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his feet. Bob yells with pain.  32. 39   CONTINUED:                                             39 Stop it! Stop hurting me! Lyn stares at the blob fondly. I bought it on line. What's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you'd never know it had such lethality. Bob holds his ear and pants for breath. Lyn's face lights up. Eyeballs. 40   EXT.

Lyn finishes, stares up at the stars thoughtfully. Sometimes there's a need, Bob. Sometimes people are calling out for something, even if they don't know it themselves. And then a man like Bill appears out of nowhere, because he heard the call.... 43   INT. FORT BRAGG - NIGHT - THE PAST                         43 A CIRCLE OF OFFICERS including MAJOR HOLTZ sit around plants. There are candles everywhere. His face is painted. SUPERED TITLES read Fort Bragg. 1980. I'd like us to begin this with a mantra. If we could all breathe in and then out, holding a long "eeeeee." The OFFICERS stare at him. There are sniggers. Bill stares them down. Breathe in... and out...  ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them. We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny.   34. 43   CONTINUED:                                                43 But to achieve it we must become the first Superpower to develop super powers. We must create Warrior Monks - men and women who can fall in love with everyone, sense plant auras, pass through walls, stop saying mindless cliches and see into the future. I want you to JOIN me in this vision.  Be ALL you can BE. Bill finishes. We TRACK along the OFFICERS' FACES - really not sure what to do or say. We reach one officer who looks like Lee Marvin. This is BRIGADIER GENERAL DEAN HOPGOOD. His eyes are shining with excitement. Amongst Bill's audience that night was Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, from the Defense Intelligence Agency. For some time the General had been concerned about information he had been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers. 44   EXT. POOL - DAY - THE PAST                                44 Wearing trunks, the Brigadier General lounges by his pool, engrossed in a PAPER-BACK BOOK titled Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain. According to some stories the Soviets were psychically spying on American bases and had designed "psychotronic generators" - machines capable of bombarding the President with negative energy. 45   INT. LABORATORY - DAY - THE PAST                          45 Two DIABOLICAL-LOOKING RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS are wiring up some KITTENS to a MACHINE. They were also conducting sadistic experiments to see whether animals had psychic powers. 46   ANOTHER LABORATORY                                        46 Another DIABOLICAL SCIENTIST is wiring up the KITTENS' MOTHER.  35. 46   CONTINUED:                                                46 Could they, for instance, telepathically detect that their babies were distressed? 47   FIRST LABORATORY                                          47 With a gloating smile one of the Scientists approaches one of the KITTENS with a lit CIGARETTE. The kitten gives a pitiful MEW as the Scientists LOOMS over it. 48   EXT. POOL - DAY - THE PAST                                48 Brigadier General Hopgood can't read on. Sick bastards... 49   INT. OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                              49 Brigadier General Hopgood is briefing two senior Pentagon OFFICIALS. But why did the Soviets begin this type of research? Well sir, it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap.  What attempt? There was no attempt, sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir. So, they've started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren't doing psi research?  36. 49    CONTINUED:                                                    49 Yes sir. But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal. The Officials consider this gravely. 49A   INT. FORT BRAGG OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY                      49A Bill looks in a mirror as he admires his new insignia.

CAR - THE PRESENT - DAWN                                 50 Bob wakes, stiff and cold, in the front of the car. He sits up and looks around, trying to work out where he is. Suddenly he realizes he is ALONE. Afraid, he scans the landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to the horizon.  Lyn? 51    EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS                                      51 Bob jumps out of the car, panicking and starts to run in a random direction.  Oh God. Oh God. He stops, staring at the immense empty landscape ahead of him. LYYYYN! What? Bob turns and sees Lyn in a YOGA pose on the roof of the car.  37. 51   CONTINUED:                                                 51 I didn't...I thought...What are you doing? Salute to the Sun. He finishes and jumps down. Okay. We're Oscar Mike. up) That's "On the Move" soldier. 52   EXT. DESERT ROAD - EARLY MORNING                           52 The car cuts across the vast landscape, the day already heating up. 53   INSIDE THE CAR                                             53 Bob is writing in his notebook as Lyn drives. He notices Lyn keeps looking up at the sky. What are you doing? Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape. Bob stares up at the clouds. Really? Which one?  That one. Bob tries to work out which cloud he means. That one? No. That one. The big one. Isn't that one too far away? Lyn looks at Bob like he's crazy. They're all far away.  38. 53   CONTINUED:                                                   53 He concentrates on the CLOUD again. Sure enough, it thins and fades until it has DISAPPEARED. Bob stares - not sure what to think. And it's gone. Lyn, smiling up at the sky, doesn't notice that the car is veering off the road a little. BANG! The two men are slammed forward as the car hits something, Bob smacking his face off the dash. 54   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                       54 We see the car has run straight into a large ROCK. This is pretty much the only vertical feature in the otherwise flat landscape. The two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the car. Bob is holding a handkerchief to his bloody nose. He looks at the car, stares around him at the desert stretching out. Jesus Lyn. You had like the whole desert to drive in... Lyn rubs his face ruefully. Yeah. I'm sorry about that Bob. Must have got a little bi- locational there, you know? But don't worry. Someone'll come along soon. 55   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY - MUCH LATER                          55 A sweating Bob sits in the shadow of the car, tossing a COIN. Lyn sits smoking. Heads.  Right. He tosses again. Heads.  39. 55   CONTINUED:                                                55  Right. He tosses again. What's your record at this? Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.  Right. That's pretty... He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK approaching. FEET) Oh thank Christ. Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG Can you help us? We drove into a rock. Could you take us to a town or someplace? Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up.  Thank you! Thanks so much! He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob. 56   EXT. DESERT ROAD DAY - BACK OF TRUCK                      56 As the Truck bumps off down the road, Bob and Lyn sit down and find themselves facing TWO YOUNG IRAQI MEN. Hi! Hello there. Thanks so much for this. The two Young Men smile in a friendly fashion.  40. 56   CONTINUED:                                                 56  Don't know if we would have lasted much longer. Phew! One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the contents.  Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh? The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's bag and inspects it.  Deep Purple. They laugh.  Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple. Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or... He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN. The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it.  Lyn? Is this...is this...?  Yeah. 57   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                          57 Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them. From next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it. We're going to die! I'm going to be killed by Al Qaeda!  41. 57   CONTINUED:                                                57 From the next room we hear the Young Iraqis start to sing along to the track, laughing. Lyn listens. I don't think they're Al Qaeda. Oh what the hell do you know? You don't know! You don't know anything! And this is all your fault! Bob, there's something I have to tell you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I've been reactivated. I couldn't tell you because this is a Black Op, but...I think you have a part to play. I think that's why you're with me. Bob collapses face down on the mattress.  You're an idiot. You want to know why I'm with you? Because I got drunk.  I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could prove to my wife I wasn't...just once that I...And now I'm going to die. She's right. I'm such a... He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy. Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory before?  Your life is like a river, Bob. If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies.   42. 57   CONTINUED:                                          57 Like those doodles you just "happened" to draw? He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his chest - very similar to the one Bob had drawn. Bob looks up. This is the Ajna chakra - the third eye - the symbol of the Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn it...well, the Universe gives me a sign like that, I don't ignore it. You're meant to be here with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you sensed that. Bob stares at the EYE. Now listen to me. I don't think these guys are FRL's or Mehdi Army... I think we're talking standard criminals here, okay? What they're gonna do is try and sell us on to another group. We can't let that happen. How are we gonna stop them? There's three of them! And they've got guns! We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't fight with guns. We fight with our minds. What do you mean? Let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.  What do you mean? Okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say "No, I'm not going to attack you." You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of his eyeballs.   43. 57   CONTINUED:                                            57 Or you use a pen, stab him in the neck, create a fountain of blood, I mean really a fountain, get the blood to squirt on his buddies. That's a psychic disincentive, right there. Bob thinks about this, a little nauseated. We haven't got a pen.  You're missing the point.  Here let me show you something. Stand up. Bob stands up reluctantly. Choke me. Oh...I don't want to Lyn. Choke me. What am I gonna do?  Just here. Choke. Choke. I don't think I...there's sharp edges around here... C'mon...with his fingers) "Attack me." Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this. What's with the quotation fingers? That's like implying I'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or... Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me.  Well, if I choose to choke you, what are you going to do? I'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.  44. 57   CONTINUED:                                            57 Bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn. Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes down into the floor behind Lyn. See? I hardly moved. Physics wise there's not much going on. It's the psychic energy that's important.  You okay?  Sharp...edges...  You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself. Yes. Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this. I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual.  You know why? It wasn't you. It was me. I was inside your head. Fighting with the Mind. Suddenly the door opens and one of the Young Iraqis comes in, smiling. Okay. We go. 58   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                              58 The White Pick-Up bounces over the sand. Bob and Lyn sit in the back with one of the Young Iraqis, who has Lyn's back-pack.  I'm sorry I freaked out, Lyn.  45. 58   CONTINUED:                                                 58 That's okay. You learnt a lesson. "Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has power."  Huh. Oprah. Uhuh.  You really don't work for DeWitts? Just my cover.  Gus Lacey said you ran a dance studio. That was just cover too, right? No. I do run a dance school. I love dance. Oh. Okay.  And you're really on a mission out here? In time, Bob.  Were you just kidding me back there - about me having some Jedi in me? We learn to recognize our own kind after a while. You ever dream about flying? Yes. That's one of the signs. Do you really think so?  46. 58   CONTINUED:                                             58 Don't you? Haven't you always really felt you were different? Bob considers this. Yes. Yes I have. That's the way it is for us. We're the ones who don't fit in as kids. Have you always had powers? Kind of. They used to call me the Jinx. Why? 59   INT.

OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                              60 Lyn stands nervously to attention in front of a very grim looking Brigadier General Hopgood. Did you crash those computers? Lyn opens his mouth to lie, but one glance at Hopgood's forbidding countenance changes his mind.  47. 60   CONTINUED:                                               60  Yes sir. Beat. A SLOW GRIN steals over the General's face.  Far fucking out... Lyn blinks. This wasn't the reaction he'd expected. How'd you feel about a transfer son? 61   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA - DAY     61 A small group of JEDI RECRUITS, Lyn amongst them, stands facing a stern Bill Django in the abandoned-looking building. The walls have been decorated with COSMIC MURALS. I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django. From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your mouth will be "Sir, yes, sir!" Do you understand? Sir, yes, sir! If you complete this course you will be a Psychic Weapon, an Angel of Death, our enemies Worst Nightmare! Until then you are Nothing! Less than Nothing! Do you understand? SIR, YES, SIR!  Yeah, I'm only kidding with that shit. Okay, what shall we do now? He stares around the men, expectantly.  Hey! Lets dance! 48. 62   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                   62 The Jedis are DANCING to some rock, encouraged by Bill. Okay! Give it everything you've got! That's it! The Jedis start to dance more frenetically, eyes closed, jumping about the room, waving their arms... Bill notices Lyn, shuffling self-consciously from foot to foot. What's your name son? Lyn Cassady sir. Where you from? Opelousas, Louisiana, sir. Bill stares at Lyn, taking in his orphan air, his hunted look. Tough place to grow up? Lyn shrugs, embarrassed.   Bill nods. You've gotta free your feet before you can free your mind, Lyn.  Not much of a dancer sir. Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes. But that isn't true is it Lyn? You can dance. It's just someone told you not to. 63   BEDROOM - 1965                                            63 A TWELVE YEAR OLD LYN - is dancing away to a track on the radio. His FATHER weaves drunkenly past the door and stops, watching.  48A. 63   CONTINUED:                                                  63 LYN'S FATHER Stop acting so fucking QUEER! He throws his beer can at Lyn and walks on. Lyn stares after him, upset. The RADIO abruptly catches FIRE. 64   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                     64 Bill watches Lyn with compassion.  49. 64   CONTINUED:                                                64 Well, I'm your commanding officer Lyn, and I'm ordering you to let the dance out! Lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon. C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go! Let it all go! Lyn starts to go for it. And it's true - he CAN dance.  Welcome to the Heroes Journey Lyn. Lyn smiles shyly.  Okay remember everyone, we don't officially exist as a unit so I'm afraid there's no coffee budget. Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no solid food for the first week. As the track continues we... 65   OMITTED                                                   65 66   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                     66 deck.

FIELD - DAY                                          70 The Jedis stand watching a JEEP driving down a course marked out on the field. 71   INT. INSIDE THE JEEP - DAY                                71 Bill sits next to a nervous JEDI TRAINEE who is driving. The Jedi is BLINDFOLDED.  Okay, you're doing very well. Now feel the next bend... 72   EXT. ON THE FIELD - DAY                                   72 The Jedis SCATTER as the jeep swerves erratically off the course and drives straight towards them... 73   INT.

JEDI CLASSROOM - DAY                                 74 The Jedis examine a blackboard on which Bill is writing: "Before going into Battle the JEDI utilizes A) Yogic Cat Stretch. B) Primal scream and leap. C) Belgian waffle. D) Ginseng E) Amphetamines." 75   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          75 The Jedis stare doubtfully at the bed of HOT COALS in front of them. One JEDI stands ready, his feet bare. Okay, only when you're ready. The Jedi nods nervously, hesitates, starts to WALK ON THE COALS, almost immediately starts to SCREAM.  51. 75   CONTINUED:                                                75  Think cold! Think real cold! 76   EXT. FORT BRAGG - ROOFTOP - SUNSET                        76 Bill leads the Jedis in the EARTH PRAYER as they face the setting sun. Mother Earth, my life support system as a soldier, I must drink your blue water. I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat. I am yours and you are mine. I salute you. 77   INT. EX-MESS HALL - EVENING                               77 Bill leads the Jedis in another dancing session - rock music blasting - the men dancing in a variety of nerdish and demented ways. Their uniforms have been supplemented with odd, personal touches: hats, badges, sunglasses, a poncho... We find Lyn dancing in blissful, idiotic abandonment. After years of feeling like an oddball Lyn had finally found a home. At last he was amongst men who prided themselves on being different. 78   EXT. BRIG. GENERAL HOPGOOD'S GARDEN - DAY - THE PAST      78 Bill leads the Jedis and Brigadier General Hopgood in a complex YOGA MOVE. We CLOSE on LYN. These were Golden Days for Lyn. There was something so noble and pure in Bill's vision that the Jedis felt themselves inspired to be more than soldiers. In a world torn apart by greed and hate they would be a force for good, for peace. A BUTTERFLY lands on Lyn's outstretched hand. He watches it with a gentle smile.  52. 78   CONTINUED:                                                  78 For the first time in his life Lyn felt truly happy. The Butterfly flits away and lands on an APPLE in the tree overhead. Then into the garden a serpent did come. 79   INT. DINNER PARTY - NIGHT - THE PAST                        79 Brigadier General Hopgood is talking to his WIFE. He turns back to find the FORK in his hand BENT DOUBLE. He looks in amazement at the man sitting beside him - Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi writer from Colorado, recruited to the Jedis after Brigadier General Hopgood met him at a spoon-bending party. Other guests laugh and applaud. 80   EXT. FUNCTION ROOM - NIGHT - THE PAST                       80 A WEDDING CELEBRATION is in progress. SCOTTY MERCER - one of the JEDI RECRUITS - is dancing, beaming with his new BRIDE. Guests - Lyn and the other Jedis amongst them - stand watching, clapping and cheering, a boisterous atmosphere of bonhomie. Larry watches the revellers with contempt. Right from the start he had made himself unpopular with the other Jedis. Scotty and his wife are walking off the dance floor. Larry stops him to shake his hand. Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry it doesn't work out for you two. Scotty's face falls. The other Jedis glare at Larry. One of them makes a move towards him but Lyn holds him back. 53. 81   INT. MESS HALL - DAY - THE PAST                           81 The Jedis eat at one table. Larry sits alone and shunned at another table. Lyn walks over with a tray, hesitates seeing Larry alone. Larry made it quite clear that he despised most of the other Jedis. Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry. Larry flushes red. But Lyn - Lyn was different.  He really hated Lyn. 82   INT. PSI EXPERIMENT ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 82 Scotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL printed on its door. A-9. The three men focus on the cupboard in question. It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil? Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent. This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug? Lyn? Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly, puzzled. It's a man on a chair. Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration from the watching Jedis.  54. 82   CONTINUED:                                                82  Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A! Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn. Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding. Larry looks daggers at Lyn. 83   EXT. FIELD - DAY - THE PAST                               83 Lyn is walking calmly over the HOT COALS as the other Jedis watch, impressed. 84   INT. GYM - DAY - THE PAST                                 84 Bill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO. Aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing ourselves with the Universe and the Way. Look upon these sessions as an opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving environment. Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease. Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn. watching Jedi's) Notice how Lyn's circular motions turned Larry's aggression back upon him. Good work Lyn. A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head. HIM) Larry, go outside, calm down. 85   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 85 Lyn lies on a couch drinking a beer, staring at a large  55. 85   CONTINUED:                                             85 Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of the NATO GENERAL inside. After a year's training, Lyn was given his first tasking. A senior Nato General had been kidnapped by Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able to help find him before it was too late.  We're north of Verona. It's a little town. There's a lake nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or...it's a cafe. He's in the apartment above. The town is called...it's something sweet.  Dolce. It's called Dolce. Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking impressed. It's true that the unit never found out whether any of their remote viewings were accurate or not. Nevertheless from that moment on Lyn's reputation soared. 86   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                   86 Lyn stands in front of the other Jedis. Rank, medals...these things mean little to the Jedi. But growth in spirit, in wisdom, in psychic power, these things earn our respect. He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER. Native Americans believed that when one received an Eagle feather, it was the mark of love, of gratitude and ultimate respect. Only true Human Beings may carry the Eagle feather. He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE. 56. 87   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 87 Lyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is playing in the room. The word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room. We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND. LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall. As Bill Django said - the Force truly was strong with this one. As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the wall, into freedom... 88   EXT. THE SKY - DAY - THE PAST                             88 As the track continues and we RACE over the land, flying faster and faster, free as a bird, swooping up towards a huge SUN, until the screens WHITES OUT and we... 89   THE SUN - RISING - THE PRESENT                            89 ...as the Pick-up with Bob and Lyn in the back pulls up next to another TRUCK. Two MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering their faces stand by it staring at them. In the back seat of the Truck sits a blindfolded IRAQI MAN. The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS with a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them. They drink and confer briefly in Arabic. He turns and gestures to the other two Young Iraqis who push Lyn and Bob down from the back of the pick-up. Lyn stands still.  Etaharrak! Lyn?  57. 89   CONTINUED:                                                  89  It's okay, Bob. We're not getting into that truck. The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck. Edkhol! Don't move Bob.  Are you going to use the Blob? Let's hope it doesn't come to that. One of the Insurgents stirs and says something softly in Arabic. The other laughs. Angrily the First Young Iraqi takes out a HANDGUN and levels it at Lyn. EDKHOL! Lyn raises one hand towards him. You can put your weapon away. You're not interested in us. The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk towards the truck.  Stay where you are Bob. Bob stops. Shit...shit... CALMLY) We can go about our business. Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his own GUN out and aims at Lyn. The tension builds. Suddenly Bob remembers the phrase he was taught.  La termi, ana sahafi!  58. 89   CONTINUED:                                             89 Immediately everyone stares at Bob. The Insurgent OPENS Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi behind him also scrambles for cover. Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him, Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK. We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR. Now at the time I thought Lyn was having some kind of fit here. Later I discovered what he was actually doing was performing the Echmeyer technique. 90   INT. DOJO - DAY - THE PAST                                90 hat. He has his eyes closed in IMMENSE CONCENTRATION. A bead of sweat runs down his face. SUPERED TITLES read: Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet with sixty-three confirmed kills. He remains the only non-Korean to achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi teachers at Fort Bragg. watching with expressions of mingled admiration and horror. It was said he could have a tug of war with a dozen men and not move an inch. We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the waist down. A SAND BAG is somehow hanging between his legs. He was also able to lift bags of sand on hooks hung through his scrotum. A RECRUIT raises a hand.  59. 90   CONTINUED:                                               90 Sir, what's the practical application of this? 91   EXT. ARMY BASE - DAY - THE PAST                          91 OVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us. We hear the sound of an approaching engine. Another demonstration involved letting a recruit drive a jeep over him. This, in the end, was to be his undoing. Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at sixty miles an hour. We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP. Before his untimely death Ben caused quite a stir by advocating his controversial "shock and awe" knife attack method. 92   INT. DOJO - DAY                                          92 Ben leaps spastically in the air, spinning and shrieking, a knife held in one hand. The approach was hailed by some knife aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab yourself. display. Lyn Cassady, however, became a firm convert to the style. We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA. Ben, you're not forgotten. The knife you gave me lies next to my beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer. 60. 93   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                               93 We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand. Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless. The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass. Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle. The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand. The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him. Beat. Nobody moves. 94   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                 94 The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the sand and swerves onto the road. Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at the road behind them. back in) They're not coming! We're okay! Oh God, we're gonna be okay! The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied. There he is. He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the running man.  61. 94   CONTINUED:                                                94 he's worth. Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind him. ENGINE) Sir? You're okay! We're Americans. We're here to help you! Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him, but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS him, sending him flying. Oh crap! What happened?  I think I just ran him over. 95   EXT. ROAD                                                 95 Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road, his head bleeding. Sir? Are you okay?  Bob, give me a hand here will you? Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to carry him back towards the truck. They stop listening to an approaching rumble. Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming! They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man dangling between them. Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck, the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK their M-16's at Lyn and Bob. dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves nervously.  62. 95   CONTINUED:                                                 95 We hear the opening of a period song as we... 96   INT. S.U.V - DAY                                           96 We're rushing over a CGI DESERT, between the CGI rivers Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from the sand. Then I say "There it is. The Future!" Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the car. Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the screen, moved. We play this on these big screens at the conferences, you know? This trumpet music blasting out. Every time I see it, it gets me. He glances over at the Iraqi Man who is holding a dressing to the cut on his forehead, pale and shaken. You a businessman, sir? The Iraqi Man nods. Yeah, Ali Babas have been targeting locals lately.out his hand) Todd Nixon, Army Small Business Office.  Mahmud Daash. Ask me what business I'm in, Muhammad.  Mahmud. What business are you in sir?  63. 96   CONTINUED:                                                96 Right now, I'm in the Quality of Life business. Nixon nods, smiling, pleased with the line.  We've got 25 million Iraqis out here who wanna be independent, wanna make something of their lives. But more than anything else they wanna buy stuff. Cell phones, digital cameras, leisure suits - you name it. If it sells in Boston, then we can damn well sell it in Baghdad!  Am I right Muhammad?  He knows what I'm talking about. We've got Halliburton, Parsons, Perini...just in the primes. We're gonna have Macdonalds, we're gonna have Starbucks...No corporate tax. It's a gold-rush. Oh, and by the way, fuck the French!  Did you hear that shit? Chirac wants to bring French contractors in? Can you believe that? Hey, Phil? Raise one hand if you like the French.  Raise both your hands if you are French! He raises both his hands.  Yeah, okay...watch the wheel Phil.  Year Zero boys. Bob nods politely. Lyn prepares an INJECTION for himself. He feels the Security Guard beside him watching. He notices the name of the company on the man's badge - Krom Security.  What's Krom? The Security Guard continues to watch him through his mirrored shades.  64. 96   CONTINUED:                                          96  God of War.  Really? Is that Norse? Conan the Barbarian. S'in the movie. Lyn injects himself. Right. Lyn notices the Chilean Security Guard on his other side has a tattoo on his arm - "Viva Pinochet!"  Okay. We're in Indian Country. Check six. The SUV's are approaching a town and other cars have appeared on the road. The Security Men on either side instantly lean out of their windows with their M-16's - aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in fear.  I was pretty down for a while about not getting any trigger time in this war Bob, but you know what I've learnt? Our greatest weapon against evil is commerce. When these people have quality consumer items they will no longer want to kill Americans. He turns to gaze at the TOWN they are now driving into. We're not gonna rest until there's a satellite dish on every one of roofs. Behind him the sound of CARS BRAKING AND SWERVING continues. 65. 97   EXT. TOWN - GAS STATION - DAY                             97 A LONG line of cars are waiting for gas - Iraqi men, women and children, suffering in the heat. Many of them have been there for hours. The SUVs approach. 98   INSIDE THE SUV                                            98 The driver of the first SUV radios Nixon's car.  We've got a line for the gas station here. Are we waiting? NIXON'S DRIVER  Negative. We'd be way too exposed. We're taking the station. Go in fangs out. He accelerates. 99   EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS                             99 ...as the two SUV's roar up, horns blaring, M-16's bristling from the windows. The lead SUV rams the car at the head of the line and sweeps it out of its path. Nixon's SUV barrels through the gap and screeches to a halt by the pumps. The THREE SECURITY MEN roll out showily, machine guns ready. Secure the perimeter! The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the first SUV blocks the road and more SECURITY pile out, guns raised to cover the line of cars. There are howls of protest from the waiting Iraqis. Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment. Give her the go-juice, Eddy! I filled her up last time. Bullshit. the window) He did fill her up last time Gary.  66. 99    CONTINUED:                                                99 With respect sir, bull-fucking- shit. I tanked her last time. Every time! Can we get some sort of fucking system so we don't... We hear a sudden, sharp POPPING sound. Immediately the Men drop into CROUCHES, scanning the area.  Contact! We've got contact! He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck down, some cars reverse desperately and collide with the cars behind. The other Security Men join in the shooting.  Where? Where's the shooter? 100   ACROSS THE STREET                                        100 Another SUV - identical, but black, is passing, hemmed in by traffic. A stray BULLET from the gas-station pings off it's armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a halt and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car - same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different color uniforms.  Contact! We're under fire! The New Detachment open FIRE blindly in the general direction of the Station. 101   GAS STATION                                              101 ...as bullets smack off the parked SUV. Two o'clock! Two o'clock! All the Security Men turns and begin spraying bullets across the road. Car windshields and windows explode. A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat.

My house is not far. We could walk from here. Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV. Sounds good Muhammad. Mahmud. 102   GAS STATION                                               102 As machine-gun fire from across the street strafes the station and Nixon's Security men return fire blindly.  Krom One this is Freedom Frontier. We are under attack. This is a Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them. 103   EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER                               103 Mahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a Kiowa Warrior passes over head. Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter opens fire with a MISSILE... 104   INT. MAHMUD'S HOUSE - EVENING                             104 a smiling Mahmud and WIFE, the glass broken... Muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence. We TRACK past a row of BULLET HOLES in the wall, a section of smoke damaged wall paper.  68. 104   CONTINUED:                                                  104 And also accidentally set on fire by a US tank. Neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren't sure where she had gone. We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The windows behind them have been partially boarded up. Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks tired, pale. They eat in awkward silence. What is this? Taameeyah. They're really good. Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs. I understood he was going     through a lot, but considering we     had saved him from kidnappers     I still thought his welcome could     have been a little warmer. Lyn clears his throat. I'm very sorry for running you over, sir. Mahmud shrugs. It was an accident.  And I apologize for that security detachment. Please don't think all Americans are like that. Mahmud nods. Beat. I apologize for the kidnappers. Lyn demurs softly.  69. 104   CONTINUED:                                            104 Not your fault sir. I mean we get kidnappers in America too, so...you know. There's always, uh, bad apples, right? The men eat in silence for a moment. Mahmud stares blankly at his plate, looking crumpled and lost. Bob watches him, faintly irritated. Lyn tries to think of something comforting to say.  Akhir il ahzan. last of your sorrows.) Mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected Arabic phrase. Did I say it wrong? Mahmud shakes his head, moved but embarrassed. No...that was right. They eat in silence. 105   INT. MAHMUD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                    105 Lyn and Bob are sharing a bed. Bob looks out of the window and notices a CLOUD over the moon. He concentrates on it, trying to "bust" it. Nothing happens. He sighs, looks over to Lyn who is staring at the wall, lost once more in dark thoughts. Lyn? What? What are you thinking? Just Mahmud. People try to build something of their lives, something lasting, something good... but there's always someone wants to smash it up... 106   OMITTED                                                  106 70. 107   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                107 Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper and the part he had played in the destruction of the New earth Army. But, in fairness, the Jedis' own eccentricities hadn't exactly won them many allies in the Army. A JEDI - TIM KOOTZ - lies on the couch in a TRANCE, Bill sitting beside him with pen and paper. For example, there was Tim Kootz who, on being asked to ascertain the whereabouts of General Manuel Noriega, had replied... Tim jerks awake from his trance.  Ask Angela Lansbury.  What's that Tim? Ask Angela Lansbury. Bill looks up to an CIA AGENT observing from the next room. The Agent frowns. 108   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY - THE PAST                           108 Bill waits a little anxiously. The CIA Agent walks up to him. We asked Angela Lansbury. And? She said she didn't know where General Noriega was. 109   INT. STAFF CAR - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST             109 base. As he stares out of the window his expression suddenly changes to one of amazement.  71. 109   CONTINUED:                                                 109 Or there was the time Major General Gilling was visiting the base and saw Jedi trainee Clifford Hickox... RUSSELL'S P.O.V - we are driving past the training course. A bare-chested, long-haired Hickox is dancing around a wooden pole to which he is attached by two long wires and metal hooks which are stuck in his bleeding nipples. ...practising the ancient Sun Dance of the Sioux Nation. 110   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST            110 Bill is introducing a young, fresh-faced recruit - The Jedis survived such minor scandals, protected, it was rumored, by a President who was a fan of both the Star Wars films and the paranormal himself. But then, one summer, a young, likeable Lieutenant called Norman Pendleton was recruited to the New Earth Army... Larry Hooper examines the new recruit with interest. 111   EXT. FIELD - MORNING - THE PAST                            111 Larry and Norm are jogging together, deep in conversation. Larry Hooper wasted no time befriending the newcomer. Desperate to compete with Lyn, Larry had been doing research into the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments which he believed could enhance his own psychic powers. 112   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                  112 Norm sits on the couch, smiling innocently as Larry wheels an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on wheels over to the couch.  72. 112   CONTINUED:                                                112 All he needed was a lab rat to try them out on, check if they were safe. Larry, making sure Norm can't see, is pouring a massive dose of LSD into a DRINK. He gives the glass a quick stir and turns, smiling, to Norm with it. 113   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - LATER                    113 Norm lies tripping on the couch, rigid, wide-eyed, wearing headphones, connected to the electronic device, which emit disturbing electronic frequencies. Larry stands at the light switch, turning the red bulb overhead on and off, eagerly watching Norm's reaction - a modern day Frankenstein. It turned out they weren't. 114   CLOSE ON LARRY - LATER                                    114 ...cowering terrified under the couch, as the sound of him. 115   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                     115 A NAKED AND DEMENTED NORM walks through the base, firing random shots at scattering soldiers with his Beretta. He finds Bill blocking his way.  Norm? Give me the gun, Norm. Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his mouth... 116   INT. DISCIPLINARY HEARING - DAY                           116 Norm's father - MAJOR GENERAL PENDLETON - stares fixedly to where Bill and Brigadier General Hopgood sit in the hearing - his expression filled with icy rage. Norm's father, who it turned out was pretty high up in the Pentagon, wanted blood.   73. 116   CONTINUED:                                               116 Although the Jedis were pretty sure Larry was responsible, nothing could be proved and when he was called to the disciplinary hearing Larry made sure to smear Bill with everything he could... 117   LARRY TALKING BEFORE THE HEARING                         117 ...looking every inch the neat, professional soldier. Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds from the project's black budget to procure prostitutes... The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill stands up, outraged. That's a lie! ...and also drugs for himself and his men. Bill jumps to his feet again. That's a... Well the hooker thing is definitely a lie! The OFFICIALS look at him as if he were SATAN himself. Brigadier General Hopgood resigned and died some years later. Bill received a dishonorable discharge. 118   OMITTED                                                  118 119   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                    119 Bill, a broken man, is walking off the base. He reaches the gates and sees Lyn waiting for him. Continue the work, Lyn. The World needs the Jedis, now more than ever. Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates closing after him. 74. 120   INT. FORT BRAGG - BARBERSHOP - DAY                       120 The Jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric clippers. The Jedi's NEW COMMANDER - MAJOR HOLTZ - not a shred of New Age sympathy in his regulation heart - walks down the line, examining his men coldly. After Bill left, Major Holtz of Special Forces took command of the Jedis. Lyn stares at his reflection as his long hair falls to the floor. And nothing was ever the same again. 121   INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - THE PRESENT               121 Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured breathing. Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep. 122   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                          122 Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is studded with burnt out CARS. Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys. I really appreciate this sir. 123   INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER                                 123 Lyn watches Mahmud in the mirror as they drive away. He stands in the middle of the road, staring at his feet. They drive on. 124   EXT. DESERT - ROAD - DAY                                 124 As the car cuts across the landscape. 75. 125   EXT. DESERT - ROAD - LATER                              125 The car has pulled over at a junction. 126   INSIDE THE CAR                                          126 Lyn sits staring out at the emptiness, looking, perhaps for the first time, worried.  Jesus Christ. We could'a bought a map if you'd said. Bedouins have been navigating this desert for centuries without maps. You can use a wrist-watch in conjunction with the sun. Well? What?  Well...use your watch. I haven't got a watch. Oh for the love of...Here... He gives Lyn his watch. Lyn looks at the watch and turns to stare at Bob. What? This is a digital watch, Bob. So? That's... So you need a watch with hands for Christ's sake! Well how the hell am I supposed to know?   76. 126   CONTINUED:                                               126 You're the navigation expert here. You told me you could find the way. Will, if you'd just be quiet for a... Turns out you haven't even got a watch! Now what the hell are we... Will you shut up? I don't need a watch. I'm using Level Two.  What? Level Two. Intuition. We were trained to make correct decisions. Somebody runs up to you and says "There's a fork in the road. Do we turn left or do we turn right? And you go... "We go right!" Bob stares at him. Just...instant? Instant.  Just like that. WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HALF Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn. Oh, it's that way?  Yes. It's this way. Right. Now you know. 127   EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS                            127  77. 127   CONTINUED:                                               127 Below us the car drives off into the empty landscape, getting smaller and smaller. Then... BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault is flipped like a toy car. A ribbon of black smoke rises into the blue sky. Silence. 128   EXT. DESERT - LATER                                      128 BOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing.  What...what happened? Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black smoke rising. IED.  What? Improvised Explosive Device. Oh Jesus. You're okay Bob. It's gonna be okay. I can't believe this. Great fucking intuition Lyn. I can't...put me down. I can walk. Put me down. Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and lies there, wheezing. Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez. Alright, c'mon... He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as Lyn sets off again.  78. 128   CONTINUED:                                               128 Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his spectacles. Bob doesn't notice. Where are we going? We should stay with the car so the army can find us. Fedayeen will find us first. Well, I disagree. I totally disagree. The Federal what? Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary. Fellas who probably laid the IED. They could be on their way now. Hold this Bob. He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised divining rods to scan the sand ahead. What are you doing? Could be IED's or mines around here. I'm checking for disturbances in the telluric current.  Are they my glasses? Lyn doesn't answer, keeps on walking, struggling a little under the weight. Beat. Jesus, it's hot. I'm so hot.  Aren't you hot?  Bob? It's pretty important you keep your mouth closed, okay? You can lose a lot of water through an open mouth. He staggers on with him. 79. 129   EXT. DESERT - LATER                                      129 Bob trails after Lyn, his shirt tied around his head, breathing hard. Lyn is still scanning the sand. I can't breathe properly. I can't...Oh boy... He staggers, manages not to fall. You're okay. I think I'm bleeding to death. You're not bleeding to death, Bob. It's shock, okay? It's just the shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be okay. If we'd stayed at the road we would be safe now! Now we've got no water, no food or, or...  Will you forget about the fucking tantric currents?  You're going to be okay. Stop saying that! I just got blown up! I'm in the middle of a desert! I'M NOT GONNA BE OKAY! Bob, you're suffering from shock. If you start panicking now your heart's gonna stop. Bob stares after him incredulously.  Is that...is that supposed to calm me down?!  You know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you can't...you wanna observe something Lyn? Observe the fucking bomb in the middle of the road!  80. 129   CONTINUED:                                                 129 Lyn walks on without answering. Bob notices the sun is sinking. Wait a minute. That's west. Al Qaim's in that direction. We're going the wrong way. The mission isn't in Al Qaim. It's somewhere near Al Qaim. Where?  I don't know. Is that...is that...is that a joke? We've come six hundred miles and you don't know where we're going? If the exact whereabouts of the Target was known it wouldn't take a Jedi to find them, would it? Bob watches Lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn and, for the first time, afraid. Who gave you the mission Lyn?  Lyn? Bill did. What? Bill did. He appeared in my trailer two months ago. A psychic projection. I could hear him calling my name. Bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak.  Oh...Oh Jesus. He needed me.  81. 129   CONTINUED:                                           129 Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Lyn. There's no mission? We're in the middle of the desert because you heard voices? There's no one here! There's no-one fucking here. Lyn starts to walk off but staggers and falls. Lyn! Bob rushes to him, kneels beside him. Lyn clutches his stomach, grimaces. Is it the Crohns? I don't have Crohns. What's the matter with you? I'm dying. Bob stares at him, stunned. I've been murdered. 130   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                      130 Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them. Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with pain. It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse. What curse? SADNESS) They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army.  82. 130   CONTINUED:                                                130 Who destroyed it? Lyn stares at the stars above, remembering, grief stricken. I did. 131   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST           131 The Jedis, now indistinguishable from other soldiers, stand white-washing over the COSMIC MURALS. Major Holtz stands watching. Yoga is not the business of the US Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars! When the dust of the Pendleton Affair had settled it revealed a surprising victor. 132   INT. MAJOR HOLTZ'S OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                132 Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT held under one arm. Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples. It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir.  I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily.  83. 132   CONTINUED:                                                 132  I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. He looks up slowly at Larry. We have men who can do this?  I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted. But we don't have the resources. Well sir...there is goat lab? 133   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                   133 The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred Goat Lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for Special Forces soldiers. We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their legs in PLASTER. The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat lab actually used to be called Dog Lab... 134   SMALL DOG STARING AT US                                    134 ...with big, brown eyes. But it turned out most soldiers didn't feel good shooting dogs in the leg... A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in hand. 84. 135   EXT. NEVADA TEST SITE - DAY - THE PAST                 135 A Goat stands tethered in the desert. TITLES read "Nevada Test Site, Frenchman Flat, 1951." ...whereas the army had long felt fine about doing stuff to goats - even testing atomic weapons on them. We hear the drone of an AEROPLANE high, high above. The goat looks up... 136   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST               136 Lyn stands facing the goats. Holtz and Hooper watch him. Lyn STARES. One of the goats STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. The goat STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. And the Goat falls over.  Holy shit. Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off. Lyn slumps. 137   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                      137 Bob listens transfixed. This was the real deal, Bob. I was at the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I'd got injured. Huh? Sympathetic injury I guess. I was bruised all over. So, it's not that the goat fought back?  Goat didn't have a chance. But...that was it?  85. 137   CONTINUED:                                               137 I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz we should try the experiment again. Only this time they said...kill the goat. 138   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                 138 Six GOATS - each wearing a NUMBERED BIB - stand in a small bare room. A SOLDIER is setting up a VIDEO CAMERA in front of them. 139   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - SECOND ROOM - THE PAST         139 Lyn sits in another bare room. Holtz and Larry Hooper stand watching him. Lyn is also being TAPED. A SOLDIER walks in carrying an envelope. Holtz takes the envelope and draws from it a piece of paper. He shows it to Lyn - the number FOUR. Take out number four. Lyn stares at the number. Lyn said he had no intention of killing the goat. 140   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                        140 Lyn flushes with indignation at the memory. There was no way! What had the goat ever done to me? It was totally against the way of the Jedi. I was just going to pretend to try so they would say, "okay - it can't be done" and forget about it. But then, as I sat there, I felt this, this pulse start inside of me and...I couldn't stop it. He turns to look at Bob, haunted. You know what I keep thinking? 141   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - LYN'S ROOM - THE PAST          141 ...as he stares, concentrating.  86. 141   CONTINUED:                                               141 Maybe deep down inside some dark part of me wanted to see if I could do it? 142   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - GOAT ROOM - DAY - THE PAST     142 Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes down. 143   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - LYN'S ROOM - THE PAST          143 A soldier runs into the room. Holtz, Hooper and Lyn turn to him, the atmosphere electric with dread and anticipation.  The goat is dead. The three men stare at him.  Goat number four?  No. Number five. 144   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                        144 Bob stares at Lyn aghast. Collateral damage?  Collateral damage.  That was it. I'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all. Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck. Every night I'd dream of that goat in its little bib, it's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out... Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.  87. 144   CONTINUED:                                                  144 The silence of the goats. Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured by his solemn expression. I finished my tour and I quit. I walked out of the unit and I never went back. 145   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                       145 Lyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for one last look at the place that has been his home. But before he could leave Larry arranged one last parting gift. Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper standing in front of him, looking WIRED. What do you wan...? Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little, holding his head. What the hell? Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after him, stunned. It was the Dim Mak. 146   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                           146 Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled. The Dim Mak? The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The Death Touch. It's like this legendary, martial arts move. It was forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order book.  88. 146   CONTINUED:                                                 146 What does the Death Touch do?  It kills you Bob. With one touch. Jesus. There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded. That was it. He'd given him the death touch and Wong died. Then and there? No. Eighteen years later. That's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it's going to take effect. He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him as he falls asleep. 147   EXT. DESERT - MORNING                                      147 The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound - a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him, the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been lying at the foot of. The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the berm and disappears from sight. Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying, staring down at something. 89. 148   EXT. BERM - DAY                                          148 Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm, following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one foot in front of the other. At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us. 149   EXT. WATER-HOLE - DAY                                    149 Bob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning sky. We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A In the BLACK we hear a VOICE. SUBTITLED) In America if I do not like my cell-phone company I change them. I am in charge. This is consumer power. 150   INT. ARMY BASE - INFIRMARY - DAY                         150 both hooked up to IV's. Sunlight slants through the shutters on the window in the cool room. The voice is coming from a SPEAKER on the wall. This is democracy. Let us work together for that. And please stop shooting at those who are only here to help. Lyn opens his eyes, looks around him. This is an old one from Cat Stevens.  Yusef Islam. That's Yusef Islam. Lyn looks at the door and for a second there's a FLASH OF A FACE staring in through the glass. Then it's gone.  90. 150   CONTINUED:                                             150 Over the speaker comes the sound of a period song. Lyn sits up, staring at the door. Bob stirs in his bed. Lyn? 151   INT. ARMY BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY                          151 Lyn walks unsteadily out of the room, towing his IV drip behind him. The door at the end of the corridor is just CLOSING. Lyn sets off down the corridor. Bob appears in the doorway behind him, towing his own IV.  Lyn? Where are you going? 152   ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                         152 Lyn passes doors, glances into the rooms beyond... LYN'S P.O.V - the room seems to house a PRINTING PRESS. A fire out of the press. We pass to the next room which seems to be a RECORDING sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard... 153   EXT. ARMY BASE BUILDING - DAY                            153 Lyn emerges blinking into the light. He stares around him. The song is playing over speakers, echoing eerily around the base. A door slides shut with a clang nearby and Lyn turns to locate the sound. A trail of FOOTPRINTS leads across the sand to a HANGAR nearby. Lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the IV. Bob emerges behind him. Lyn! Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior. Bob catches him up.  91. 153   CONTINUED:                                                153 I don't think we should... He stops following Lyn's gaze... The place is full of GOATS. Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances into the darkness, peering around him. In the shadows at the back of the building a figure STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the man - old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy drinking. It's BILL DJANGO. Lyn stares at him.  Hello Bill. Bill smiles hesitantly. Hello Lyn. Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer. This is Bob. Hello Bob. Bob is too amazed to reply. Oh good... Bob and Lyn turn to find Larry Hooper standing in the doorway behind them. ...the gang's all here. Lyn stares at Larry - shocked. 154   INT. BASE - PSIC HQ - DAY                                 154 Larry and Bill are showing Bob and Lyn around. A few This is primarily a Psyops base.  92. 154   CONTINUED:                                                154 Psy for psychic?  Psy for psychological, although the irony isn't wasted on me. Radio broadcasts, leaflets, that sort of thing. Bob picks up a LEAFLET. Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet they dropped on us.  "American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds." Yeah, hadn't exactly done their homework there. Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly at the racks of CD's. Larry notices. How'd you find us, Lyn? I remote viewed you. Larry smiles a little mockingly. If this is Psyops what are you doing here? I said primarily Psyops. This is a restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison. Bob nods a little nervously. There are individuals in the current administration who are looking for...creative solutions for the War on Terror.   93. 154   CONTINUED:                                           154 They're far more open minded then their predecessors, and they've out-sourced experimental research to my company. He indicates the PSIC name badge he's wearing. "Sick?" It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill.  You're working for him? Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear. Bill's been looking into subliminal messaging. disc) This is one we've designed to play to our own troops before combat. He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a burst of a period song. There's a subliminal message in this?  This is..."Don't get drunk before firing heavy machine guns." We've got all sort of products in development. Tell them one of our new ideas. Air bag mine? Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine, catapults the fucker up into air.  Gimme another one. 2ND PSIC WORKER Blast target with pheromones and then release Attack Bees.  94. 154   CONTINUED:                                            154 Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of Nature! Another. 1ST PSIC WORKER Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses and... We're not doing that anymore!  Idiot! He turns back to Lyn. The point is we've got a budget, we've got supporters. I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army. Only this time without the hippy crap. Bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily towards the door. You okay Bill?  Gonna get some ice-cream. Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to Lyn. You get the odd flash of what he used to be but... he's pretty burnt out with the booze. Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices some candy on a desk. Ooo, Twizzlers. He picks it up and starts to eat it.  You want one? Lyn shakes his head, trying not to show the emotions he is feeling.  God, I love these things... 95. 155   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY                               155 Bob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops, listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from somewhere nearby. 156   INT. BASE - CELL CORRIDOR - DAY                          156 Lyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an annoying children's show song or heavy metal. We TRACK towards the door... Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and peers in. LYN'S P.O.V - An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD.  The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the whimsical music the whole scene is horribly sinister. Lyn steps away from the spy-hole.  What? What is it? It's the Dark Side. 157   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - DAY                              157 Lyn sits on his bed, as low as we've ever seen him. Bob watches him, concerned. What are you going to do? Lyn stares at the wall. Lyn? What are you going to do? It's too late...I'm dying, Bob.  96. 157   CONTINUED:                                               157 Oh, you're not dying! I don't believe you can kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum. You can't... Dim Mak. Whatever. I don't believe you can just... It's cancer. ...just tap someone and ...it... What? I mean, I know it was caused by the Dim Mak. But...it's...you know...it's cancer. That's what the doctors say. Different ways of looking at...different names for a reality or, or uh... He lapses into silence. Bob is stunned. Lyn lies down. I shouldn't have come Bob. Shouldn't have come. Lyn pulls the EAGLE FEATHER from the chain around his neck. ...Give this back to Bill...I don't deserve it. Bob stares at him. 158   EXT. BASE - DAY                                          158 Bill Django sits cross-legged in the sand, drinking from a bottle of whiskey, watching the sun set. Bob marches up to him, stands awkward but determined. I think you should go and see Lyn, sir.  he needs you. Bill doesn't answer.  97. 158   CONTINUED:                                                158 The man crossed a desert to see you again. Bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. Bob watches him with mounting frustration. You know, he told me all these stories about Bill Django, and I was pretty excited to meet you, but I've gotta tell you...you're one big disappointment. Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns back, and throws the FEATHER down at Bill's feet. He told me to give you that back. I don't know why. Its supposed to be a mark of honour isn't it? I don't see how you deserve that. Beat. Bill turns to look at Bob for the first time. He takes a long drink.  It isn't real. What isn't? The feather. Twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather. This one's off a turkey. You just die the tip black.  Don't tell Lyn. Bill stares at the feather. None of it was real.  That isn't true. That isn't true. He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD floating in the sky. Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful... Bill notices and watches, curious. Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS.  98. 158   CONTINUED:                                         158 Bob can't believe it. He looks at Bill who is staring at him. He has tears in his eyes. 159   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - NIGHT                         159 Lyn lies sleeping. Larry sits at the foot of his bed, smoking a cigar. He watches Lyn for a moment, then COUGHS deliberately. Nothing. He repeats the cough - louder. Lyn wakes. Oh. Didn't mean to wake you. The two men stare at each other. Heard you weren't feeling well?  Just tired. How'd you find us? I told you. I remote viewed you.  Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he? No. Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work. I haven't seen Scotty. That's funny, because he told me he'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here.  Isn't that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don't you? Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true. It can happen. You've only got to say the word. Could be the new Golden Age for Psi research.                  99. 159   CONTINUED:                                                 159 You, me and Bill, back together again. Just like the old days. Larry closes his eyes, trying to remember something. Mother Earth, my life support system. As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and eat your green skin. Lyn listens, moved despite himself. 160   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          160 Bill and Bob stand on a picnic table, under the full moon. Bill is leading Bob through some YOGA POSITIONS. Both are drunk. I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat. 161   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - NIGHT                              161 Lyn can't help but join in the prayer. Carry my body through space and time. You are my connection to the Universe... 162   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          162 Bill and Bob both stand in a difficult position - balanced on one leg. ...and all that comes after. I am yours and you are mine. As we watch Bill slowly topples forward off the table and crashes out of sight below. 163   INT. ARMY BASE - ROOM - NIGHT                              163 The two men finish the prayer. I salute you.  100. 163   CONTINUED:                                                 163  Don't make a decision now. Tell me in the morning. He pats Lyn's leg, walks out. 164   EXT. BASE - NIGHT                                          164 Bob is holding a concussed Bill who has a cut on his head. Bill? Bill are you okay? Bill opens his eyes suddenly. I just saw Timothy Leary.  Timothy Leary's dead. I know. He's had an idea. 165   INT. CORRIDOR/KITCHEN - NIGHT                              165 Bill and Bob head down the corridor. They pass a SOLDIER.  Good evening sir.  Getting some ice-cream. They walk on and reach the doors to the KITCHENS. The two men hesitate, look at each other... Then Bob walks in. 166   INT. BASE - CANTEEN - MORNING                              166 together, talking, laughing. Bob and Bill sit drinking coffee. Lyn appears with a tray and sits down beside Bob.  101. 166   CONTINUED:                                                    166 They eat in silence for a moment. Lyn turns to look out of the window to where Larry Hooper stands outside in the early morning sun, smoking a cigar and drinking coffee. He turns and notices Lyn, raises his cup, smiles. Lyn looks troubled. Bob suddenly leans into Lyn.  Don't eat the jello. Lyn turns to Bob puzzled.  What? Don't eat the jello. Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand at his feet - a small insect of some kind. He begins to watch it with strange fascination. After a moment he sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it. One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly. His neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to laugh himself. Lyn looks around him, sensing the strange atmosphere creeping through the room. What's going on? We put LSD in the jello. Lyn turns to stare at him. What? Bill showed me where Larry had bottles of LSD. So we put it in the jello mix last night.  And in the water. Bob turns to stare at him. What? I put it in the main water tank as well.  102. 166   CONTINUED:                                              166 Bob stares at him, aghast. But...we've drunk the water.  Yeah. He pours himself another coffee.  The weather? The weather is going to be HOT! Through the window we see Larry get on his belly to get a better look at the bug. 167   INT. RADIO STATION - MORNING                               167 The DJ SOLDIER has gone off script. A PRODUCER is trying ineffectually to pull him away from the desk.  I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't looked at the, the thing but I'd say it's going to be fucking HOT! Hot. Hot. Hot. The Producer pulls and releases the DJ's headphones so they slap against his head and starts giggling. That hurt Greg, you fucking dip- shit. You fuckity fuck dip-shit fuck-hole.  Hey! Music! He hits a button. 168   EXT. BASE - MORNING                                        168 the base. We BOOM down to where two SOLDIERS are dancing, tripping. Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone, staring with a beatific smile at the sky.  103. 168   CONTINUED:                                               168 As the music plays on a STRYKER ARMORED VEHICLE drives around the corner of a building, a SOLDIER standing up, arms raised, in the gun turret. The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading straight for the GATES of the base. the vehicle) You're going to hit the gates. You're going to hit the gates. The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert.  It's okay. You missed them. 169   INT. RADIO STATION - MORNING                             169 The DJ and the Producer are wrestling over the sound desk, laughing. 170   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR                                     170 Bob and Bill walk towards the cell block.  Don't you think it might have been more sensible if we hadn't drunk the fucking water? That might have aroused suspicion. But don't worry. Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics. 171   INT. CELL - MORNING                                      171 An IRAQI PRISONER looks up startled as the door to the cell is flung open and Bill stands, filling the doorway, bare-chested, wild-eyed and wild-haired. In the name of the New Earth Army and loving people everywhere I'm liberating this base! 104. 172   INT. GOAT SHED - MORNING                                 172 Lyn slides open the door to the shed and begins to shoo the goats out into the light. 173   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        173 As the music continues Bob, Lyn and Bill appear leading a column of nervous IRAQI PRISONERS out of the building, towards the gates. Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers - it's as close as they can get to the illustration from the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop the procession. Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his face blank. Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly, Larry starts to cry.  Give me the gun Larry. Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses. Scratches his head. Wow. I'm hungry. He wanders off. LAUGHING) Hey! More music!  Get off, will ya? Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period song.  Okay, let's go. 174   FLATTENED SECTION OF FENCE                               174 Bob and Lyn stand at one side, Bill at the other, beckoning the prisoners through, hugging the prisoners as they pass through. We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.  105. 174   CONTINUED:                                              174 One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence, staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap. Nothing happens, no one shoots them.  That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama. The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand. Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top. 175   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        175 Bob, tripping heavily, is staring with fascination at the sand trickling through his fingers. Suddenly we hear the building whine of the HELICOPTER engine starting up. Bob looks up, puzzled. 176   HELICOPTER                                               176 Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls. Lyn is holding the flowers. Bob appears, hurrying over.  Wait! Wait for me! Where are you going...what about the mission? the engine) You are the mission Bob! You are the mission! Tell them what happened! The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying, staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises his hand. The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves goodbye. At the time I was hurt that Lyn hadn't taken me with him. But now I know it was because he and Bill had already seen what was to come. 106. 177   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                          177 As the helicopter flies off into the blue. Nobody knows exactly what happened. The official story is that their helicopter must have crashed, either because they were hit by an RPG or because...well, that's what happens when you fly a helicopter while you're tripping on acid. All I know is they've never been seen since. Like all Shaman they returned to the sky. The helicopter disappears altogether. 178   INT. MICHIGAN APARTMENT - EVENING                          178 concentration. When I got back home I wrote the story up. Everything. 179   EXT. OUTSIDE BOB'S OLD HOUSE - EVENING                     179 Bob sits in his car staring at his old home, across the road. Through the window we can see Bob's ex-wife Debora, eating dinner with Bob's ex-Editor - Dave. I sent it to the newspapers, the radio stations, the TV stations, because that was what Lyn wanted me to do. The people needed to know. 180   INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - EVENING                             180 Bob sits watching a Today style show on TV. I was ready for whatever they would do to me. I was ready to disappear. I was ready to go to prison. I was a Jedi and I was fighting for the New Earth Army.   107. 180   CONTINUED:                                                  180  But they didn't put me in prison. They did something much worse.  And finally, US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and many parents would agree! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song. I think after an hour of that they'll spill the beans! Don't you? Let's go outside to Al for the weather. Bob watches, ashen. 181   INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY                                 181 Bob is working for another small town newspaper. He sits at his desk, staring fixedly ahead at the wall. That was it. That was the only bit of my story that ran anywhere. And it was a joke. And if I ever needed proof of how the Dark Side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be and had twisted it, destroyed it, that was it. Bob stands up. He starts to walk down the office, his face set with grim determination. BOB'S EDITOR Bob? But I won't stop. I won't give up. Bob quickens his pace. Because when I look at what is happening in the world, I know that now, more than ever, we need to become ALL that we can BE. Bob is running.  108. 181   CONTINUED:                                            181 Now, more than ever, we need the Supermen. Bob rushes towards the WALL. Just as he is about to hit it we FREEZE FRAME. We hear the opening of a period song.
