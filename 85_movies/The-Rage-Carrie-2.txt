Written by Rafael Moreu 13 FEBRUARY 1998 "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain That would save you dear lady from going insane" Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues Perhaps even eerie. On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without waves or ripples. A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint. The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood. INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out. A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can, then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall: until it reaches &pleated drape -- -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped. A PUPPY, a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird. The dog looks over to... A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the verge of tears. The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral, forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame. Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel to the floor, extending around a modest living room. Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn, haggard- She hasn't slept in a while. The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a little frightening. Mommy This is a very careful line. Momma, come play with me. In my room. But her mother keeps painting across a door. Right now, mommy, okay? her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's I got a idea, we could-- -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a wheep whe ep siren, then:  If you need help, dial nine one one. If you need help, dial nine one one. A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1. BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background. Hello? It's my mom. She's doing some... some wrong things. She's doing wrong things, so, and, you should come. EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE Its dashing red lights splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and robes, watching... her hands in plastic restraining cuffs. A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a poncho over her head. Rachel? Rachel, are you okay? She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into the ambulance. Momma! She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back. Honey, she just has to go somewhere, to get some rest, so she'll feel better. As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her mother in the rear windows, watching her. is your dad around? When's he get home from work? I don't have a dad. The POLICEMAN collects himself. Okay. Then we're going to take you someplace nice, with a family, a really nice family, till we get all this sorted out.  No. WE'LL JUS She breaks free, races into. 4. INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside, as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it -- a hall. Another door slams shut behind her. She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To her left... A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a A CLOSET where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms. The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world. In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy. There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door. NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her shoulder blade. Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it. There's a knock on her bedroom door. Rachel. c et up. You're gonna be late again. She rolls over, blinks awake. She's beautiful, with sensual lips framed by raven black hair. joy. BLACK. A SUPER burns in: M.

She dons her daily armor -- -- Slipping on multiple earrings. -- Applying Kohl around her eyes. -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate captioned "Manson Sucks". -- Disheveling her long black hair. Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open ground floor window. Sorry, Walt. And gently lowers him outside. EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is run down and in the section of town where people have cars in their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is overgrown, there's broken glass on the street. INT. KITCHEN - MORNING The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN, 40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He goes straight for the refrigerator. to augment their income. 6. looks at his ..rife.  Working tonight? Graveyard shift, again.  Was the dog in the house last night? He's allowed in the morning.  Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've been over this ground. I only brought him in this morning. No juice? We're out of a lot of things.  I heard dog noises last night. When I was trying to sleep.  Walter was not in the house last night.  You watch that voice in this house. While you're here, you'll respect her as your mother, and treat her as such.  Sorry. She picks through her cold cereal in silence. Your mom's making progress isn't she, on the new medicacions, the tricyclics? 7. Yes, ma'am.  May I be excused? Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl.  And you should take that thing outta your nose. Don't you have enough holes in your head? As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies. Yes, sir. EXT. HOUSE - MORNING black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence. A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up. Later, Walt. On WALTER, bummed. A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal.  Well, hullo. She speaks. She opens her mouth and sounds come out. The sounds are words. What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a pain again? 8. Why are you so weiz.ly happy? o I look any different? Do you look any...  Oh, my gawd. You did it. Yep. With who? You'd never believe me if I told you. I'm bringing him to lunch. C'mon. ' 1 Fess up. All will be revealed in due time. gives it to LISA. You suck. I love you too. Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them together; a pantomime of blood sisters. Best Blood. / Best Blood. ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces. Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout a threesome?  Lunch. Meet me in the parking lot. 9. EXT. BERGEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING A modern, windowless school, shrouded in mist. It's beautiful in an eerie "Fall of the House of Usher" way. E SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING Hung over the concrete entrance is a large bedsheet BANNER with oversized red lettering: The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner. The two major school cliques are... on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls. A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail separates Freak Hall and.., a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks, student government types and others who have no idea what it is to be alone on a Saturday night. At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs: There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie Vedor if Eddie ever played football. Next to him is... Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large, doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC.  Hey, Mark, the girl over there, how many if I do her? 10. Six.  Hold it. I did her last week, I only got five. She was having a bad hairday. A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup. away. MARK leans in to JESSE. Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man. Jump her bones. I JESSE Yeah, whatever. What's the matter with you, she's got an ass stamped "Made in Heaven I don't know, you ever have a conversation with her? It's like talking down a well. She only wants me cause I'm on the football team. So what? You want her to want you cause of your dazzling personality? Look, you want someone to talk to, you got us. H, you screw. watches LISA pass.  Woof- Coyote date. That's harsh, man, keep it down. 11 What's a coyote date? When you wake up in the morning, and she's sleeping on your arm, and the only way to get up is to wake her. So you gnaw your arm off instead. A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes. Hello Montagues, hello Capulets. A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school. line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away. INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY The ENGLISH TEACHER strolls among the student's desk. RACHEL is in social Siberia, sitting in the back. Okay, then how many saw the movie? A show of hands, all the girls, some of the boys. Now, how many read the play? A few tentative hands, including JESSE. I thank you for your honesty, but I am saddened. I'd like to think we're here to study William Shakespeare, not worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio. Scattered laughs. I was going to calk about the language. But since you haven't Z&&d the language, let's talk about the plot. 12. Sighs of relief Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers meant for each other, pulled apart by their families, society, and, some might say, by fate.  Why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation? The STUDENT' s faces are blank. What are some other stories with this theme?  How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca? Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand. You meair like in Dumb and when the girl's husband showed up? The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable. Okay, well. Perhaps at some level we know that Lauren Holly's husband  Rachel? I don't know that I believe in it. Believe in what? Love.  Well, then you've got bigger problems than passing this crass. 13.  Love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten. Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at RACHEL, whispers to AMY... Who would love her? Do you think that all love stories are tragedies? I mean, unless they die at the same time, all lovers are eventually separated by death. Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy, because the only way they could really be together was in death. Very good.  A foul cynic, most cliche.  A true romantic, how refreshing. Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this side of him. The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus. Food! Next assignment, Brave New World, the book, not the TV movie. INT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door.
