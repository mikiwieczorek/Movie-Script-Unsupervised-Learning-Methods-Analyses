Written by Steven Zaillian A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings - An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin - a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver. What kind is it? I don't know.    White. And the frame? Dark. Postmark? Same as last time. No note. No. Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan. I can't take it anymore. I know. I'm sorry, Henrik. There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in. It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now burst outside - 2. 2. Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building. As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing in his direction. Without stopping - What is this, the media event of the year? Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work. Don't try to play it up, that won't either. Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime, which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him - Will you appeal? I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a real story to cover. He hurries off in the rain. Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel against financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee, and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only one there who watches it - no one else is interested - which only makes it worse. 3. 3. In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia. I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a good journalist who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered. He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences. Marlboro Red ... and a lighter. Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more. 4. 4. Where you been? Walking.    Thinking. Smoking? Just one. TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety. I have.    Who else? Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated. You've been on the phone all day then. I'm as much to blame for this as you. You are?    You wrote it? I read it.    I ran it. Not the same. Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael. Mine is. 5. 5. I'm tired. I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week. Alone? He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.' I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight. A motorcycle dives down a driveway that burrows under a three-story building. Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client. It's possible we could wait forever. You called her, I thought.     You spoke to her. I'm afraid that doesn't mean much. I don't understand. No one here likes her. So it's better if she works at home. But you told her I wanted to meet her. But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients. The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby. From behind we can't see him/her well, but can see wary looks from others emerging from and getting into the elevator. 6. 6. But you like her. Very much. She's one of the best investigators I have. As you saw from her report - The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long. INSERT: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander. But. I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different. In what way. In every way. The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away. SECRETARY/INTERCOM Ms. Salander's here. Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in.' Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots. Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me. Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. How do you do? 7. 7. Something wrong with the report? No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it. There's nothing not in it. Your opinion of him isn't. I'm not paid to give my opinion. So you don't have one? He's clean.   In my opinion. He's - excuse me? He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset. There's less in his asset column after his conviction today. That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character. Are you saying he was set up? 8. 8. That wasn't part of my assignment. You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally. How big of a fool did he make of himself financially? The judgement will just about empty his savings. May I go? Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include? Nothing that warranted inclusion. I'm not sure if that means yes or no. I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated. Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't. He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home. 9. 9. You were right not to include that. I know. Anything else? No. Please think before you say no. I did. I don't want to be surprised by something later. Salander offers nothing more. So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure.  He likes sandwiches. Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika - in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather jacket. She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it. Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home. Sorry. What are you doing? 10. 10. Writing the press release. Saying - You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment. You're giving up. Just taking a few steps aside. For you. This makes me sick. Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60 Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail. She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door. It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open. She comes into an apartment which looks like it could belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor. Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess table and, next to it, a body. The gash on the old man's head could have been caused by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing. Calls for an ambulance. It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with eggnog are: 11. 11. You needed a better attorney.       You needed your sister. She offered. He declined. As she hoped. Never a good idea mixing family and business. And I still would have lost. Did you have ... anything on him. I had a lot.    It just wasn't any good. It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions. I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to worry about me. Mom's worried. About me? About all that money. 12. 12. Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable. The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets up to hear his report - You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter? His ward.   He doesn't have a daughter. The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her. Please. Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils. He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Either from the fall itself, or a stroke that led to the fall. His blood pressure is still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured. And it's possible, if he does, there will be neurological damage. They're around the dinner table now, passing platters around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed in silent prayer. Nilla?    What are you doing? Nothing.  You're not serious. 13. 13. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve. Of -  Nilla. Light of Life. Light of - what?  What is that? You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to. Excuse me. Hello. Mr. Blomkvist? Yes. Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode. I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of  - Of course. He'd like to speak to you about a private matter. 14. 14. You know, you're calling at an awkward time. I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to Christmas dinner myself. That's not what I mean. You're referring to your recent legal trouble. That has provided Mr. Vanger with some entertainment. Excuse me? He doesn't care for Wennerstrom either. Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling Blomkvist in like a perch. Have him call me. He'd like to meet in person if that's okay. Up north. Hedestad. No.   Sorry. He's much too old to make a trip to Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please. If you'd be so kind as to consider. Blomkvist isn't sure what to do, or say. Hedestad is lovely in winter.      Like a Christmas card. Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels even more cut off from the people around her than usual; completely alone. 15. 15. A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm, makes its way north. This is no Christmas card. Blomkvist stares out at the bleak, northern landscape. Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat. Frode's Mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the old industrial town to a rocky island. First time in Hedestad? And last, I'm sure. It's lovely in the spring. You said it was lovely in winter. This is unseasonable. I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish. The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any attention; just someone hunting. Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm. 16. 16. It is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces. And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly as they come through the house - Thank you for coming way out here. Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's insufficient coat. Would you like to freshen up? We'll be having dinner later. For now, hot tea is waiting. Unless you'd like a drink instead. What would you like? Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm. What? I can't stay for dinner. Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt. Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair. What do you know about me? That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country. Used to.   That's correct. There are framed black and white photographs on a wall - factories and trains figuring into all of them. 17. 17. My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines.   We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.  You know what our most profitable product now is?  Fertilizer. Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug. I'm not obsessed with the declining health of the company, but I am with the settling of accounts - and the clock is ticking. I need your help. Doing. Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ... my family. She exhumes an unwashed bowl from a sinkful of dirty dishes, fills it with tap water without rinsing it, dumps a packet of ramen noodles in, puts it in a microwave. She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork, unwashed laundry. The only things of any value here are her MacBook and several external hard drives. NOTE:   Changes below are INSERTS only: 18. 18. She types Dirch Frode in the search window. Clicks on the top result which takes her to Frode's bio on Vanger Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo. His official company photo accompanies his profile: Uppsala University Law School ... Assistant Counsel, Vanger Industries, 1965-1972 ... Head Counsel, 1972- present. She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him alongside his bio. She skims it - President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ... personal wealth of 12 billion dollars  ... 82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ... She does a third search, types: Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached' option - There are only a couple of results that include both terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and blue, and reads - ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ... Hmmm. The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white - This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard. The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger shows Blomkvist. Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. 19. 19. Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom.  The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried. Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie. They're still called that. Are they?   Okay. He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on. Someone has to do it. That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet. 20. 20. A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet. She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person. And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ... Something happened to her? Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ... Someone in the family murdered Harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane. The 4:30 train leaves the station without Blomkvist. Anna gathers the cups and leaves with the tea tray. It was September 21st, 1966.    A Saturday. Harriet was 16. Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds. My brothers - along with their wives, children and grandchildren - had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the Yacht Club held its Autumn parade. And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls. 21. 21. Harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it. She returned a little after two o'clock. A clock in the room reads, 2:10.    Vanger and a few family members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears. She came to the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. I honestly don't remember what I was doing that I thought was more important, but I told her to give me a few minutes. She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room. But in a few minutes, before I could go upstairs to talk to her, something else occurred. A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the car and spewing gasoline. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet - and everything. Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash. Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look. It was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing. People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge. Police, an ambulance, fire brigade, reporter, photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town, as those of us on the island - the family - hurried to the bridge from our side. 22. 22. The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but the other motorist is trapped. The driver of the car - a Mr. Aronsson - was pinned and severely injured. All we could do was try to pry him out with our hands - since metal tools could spark. A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues - About twenty minutes after the crash, Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ... As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help. We finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital, and those of us on our side drifted back to the house. The family has assembled at a long dining table. The sun was down, the excitement over, we sat down to dinner. That's when I noticed Harriet wasn't there. Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else, including the young man from the bridge, his jacket draped on his chair, passes platters of food around. And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next forty years. 23. 23. Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he leads Blomkvist up some stairs. What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen? She couldn't have run away? Not without being seen. The crews continue their work under lights. Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked. She couldn't have fallen and drowned? The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing. No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall. 24. 24. These were from her. And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers - These, from her killer. Blomkvist regards the forty ... Who knows about these? Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you. It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number tones the woman keys in the code lock. The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside. Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones in the Milton Security lock. Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters, Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera. She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass. The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom. The rain here is icier and more punishing. When the police investigation petered out, I kept at it - 25. 25. They're eating dinner now in the dining room. - studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth. I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money. We haven't discussed your fee. We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years. You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as Vanger refills his wine glass. Here's what I propose: You come stay on the island. I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material I give you. You find something I've missed - or you don't. You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time. Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now.  As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery. 26. 26. Mr.  - I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed. He began his career working for me. And I've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it. Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking. It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back into the shadows of his dark apartment. Would you like to sit? I could possibly clear a place if necessary. It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish that. The place is like a junkyard. Even the unmade bed is covered with stuff. Did you make it? Have you something for me? She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him.    He counts it and is unimpressed with its total. I'm on welfare; I don't administer it. This isn't enough. 27. 27. I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now. I find that so poignant. So much so that he does nothing more than look at her. She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands. While it's clear both these people are deficient in behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell which lacks it more. No `thank you?' Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks, comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to- go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor. You can't be serious - He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and gathers the rest. We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir? You fired me; I need something to do. You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole. You know what this is going to look like. Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am. They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup. 28. 28. Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him. There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone. He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside. It's four hours by train.   It's not the North Pole. The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him. He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand. As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror. Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon? This is the North Pole. The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow. Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold. Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and a small printer. 29. 29. He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him. What.   Milk? He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing. He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water. Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't. He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food. He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again. Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here. Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail. It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold. He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge. As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout. 30. 30. Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones. In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box. The bell in the church tower clangs - But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes. I'm Gunner.   The caretaker. As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents, fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums. You're an author. I'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger, yes. Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. Maybe he took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down. I saw you on television. That's unfortunate. Bit of trouble, I guess. Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to the subject. It isn't. No jail time, though. That's good. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah? 31. 31. Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made. There. Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed. The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. He was there that day? Indeed he was. Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds - That's his daughter Cecilia's house. They don't speak. Does anyone speak to anyone on this island? Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there -  - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons I don't speak to her.  Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. Who doesn't he speak to? You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald. 32. 32. I'm quickly losing track who's who. Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies.  Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother. Who speaks to him? I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you. Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. I just met him. He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. He lives over there. And you live here. Sorry? Your house. 33. 33. Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list. A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve. I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian. It's unlikely he understands what she has said.        It's unlikely he even knows she's there. Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist has written the names of the living Vanger family members and staff in the approximate locations of their houses. Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree - which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards is the word, `deceased.' He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m." Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to pump the gasoline from the overturned truck. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby Island, 11:42 p.m." Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan sitting in the living room looking suitably worried. I'd like to see the girl's room. It's down the hall. 34. 34. I thought this was your house. It is.    She lives with me. Are her parents alive? Her mother is. Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a woman as venomous as she is beautiful. This way. Morell follows Vanger down a hall - INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx. 12:05, inspected missing girl's bedroom. Found - " A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief, wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address book. He leafs through this. DET. MORELL I want to speak to everyone here. That'll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on. What about the search? First thing in the morning. No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there. Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide. Please.   I beg you. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell." 35. 35. The police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs. The weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their interviews with Morell. At the moment, he's across the room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee. INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Patrol 014 and Orienteering Club volunteers assembled, 6:40 a.m." Search parties crisscross the island, wade through ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys. Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods. We searched for days ... A train bisects the landscape.   Blomkvist looks out. Eventually, much to his dismay - and mine - I had to talk to Henrik about calling it off - As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the water. Somehow he knows they're never going to find her. The fact that I never found a body didn't surprise me. You can't dig up an entire island. The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe. 36. 36. But   I also couldn't find a motive. Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did   she know something someone wished she   didn't? Was it about business? Business?   She was sixteen. And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't. She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them. She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated. I have one. So you know.  Did you bring the last gift Henrik received? It's at the National Forensic Lab. I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA. I wanted to ask you about this. 37. 37. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. It's the last page I'm curious about. As was I. The only names not alphabetized. They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry. I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. Was this also a missing girl case? 38. 38. No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case. An unexciting social welfare building. As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned. How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind.  Terrible. It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs through her file - What exactly do you do at this security company? Make coffee and sort mail. But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August? Nothing from her. How much do you earn there? Enough. How much is your rent? 39. 39. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ I pay my rent. When's the last time you were late? Never. Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive? Here's the problem. There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances. It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances. But that's not clear to me. I'm not a child. No.  You're not.  But you were. And between then and now -  - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this -  - not to mention how you're looking at me now - I can see you haven't. So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are over. Starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.  40. 40. If the numbers don't balance, I'll have to assume the difference is going to drugs. I've been on my own since I was twelve. No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve. She won't look at him any more - not that there's anything even remotely interesting to see if she did. Ms. Salander? Please look at me. Because this is important. She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you. This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here -  - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined. Is that what you're saying with your silence? You'd prefer institutionalization? Salander steps into the elevator, hits the down button. As the doors close - Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him. Mikael?  We're going to the same place. Hop in. Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch. 41. 41. I found him at death's door halfway up the hill. I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape. No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in. Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand. The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern. Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere. I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Goteborg. When it was sold, I went with it. A dark day. I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. She comes for the moose steak. Is that what this is? They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange, wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in Blomkvist's glass and gets up. Something's open. You like this one, or would you like to try something else? That one's good. Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about. I saw you on Sky News a while ago. 42. 42. That was a dark day. Sorry to remind you of it. It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business. You're writing a book now, Martin said. Henrik's biography. I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New. They are. You know about Harriet, right? You don't? I do. The family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug. What can't. Harriet. 43. 43. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ Maybe we could talk about that later. We can talk about it now.  Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me. That's one reason. Don't put that in your book. Anything else is fine. Harriet certainly. Everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company. How so. We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart. You were here that day? Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train. I know it well. 44. 44. It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse. Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's. This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book. Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will. As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of her messenger bag from her shoulder - She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down, but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now. She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station. Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks, a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ... A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch. Hi. I thought I'd come over and say hello. I'm Cecilia. Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo? and a Post-It with her name on it. We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. 45. 45. It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company. Like I said. It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. Unlike the one that landed you in court. Unlike that one. Correct. So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet. I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus. So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation. enough to respond) I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like? I'm sure Henrik has told you. He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age. 46. 46. Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her. I'd love to, where is she. If I had to guess - London. You don't know where your own sister lives? I haven't seen her in years.       We never really got along. I'm getting used to that comment. That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys. People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point. Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. I'll try to track her down for you. Don't bother. For myself then. 47. 47. If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off. A tech tries to get beyond the dreaded blinking "?" on the laptop's cracked screen. You backed up? Hard drives at home, yeah. That's good.    This one's dead. Salander against the store window, cell phone to her ear. I'm sorry, he's booked all day. It'll take five minutes.      It's important. Hold, please. Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they always do. The secretary comes back on. Seven o'clock. Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise empty corridor. At the far end, she opens her new guardian's office door. As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits. The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops. Have you ever had an STD?  When's the last time you were tested for HIV?  48. 48. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ  How many partners have you had in the last month?  How many were men? I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health. Write down anything you want. Why do you need such an expensive computer? For work. Making coffee and sorting mail. I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before. And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that?  Shall we start with me?  Shall we start now? If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. That's how normal people are. You've done this before.   You know what to do.  49. 49.  Do you want this computer or not? He takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his trousers. You feel that? That's gaberdine. Unzip them.  And ...  And ...  I like the reticence. I prefer a whore who pretends she isn't. It's almost convincing. He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him. Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him calmly writing a check. Here you go.   As promised. He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it, pulls it back a little. I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date. Enjoy your computer games. She takes the check and leaves. She sits cross-legged in the dark. Thinking. Or plotting. The dragon tattoo visible on her bare back. Blomkvist, who doesn't care for flying, pours two mini- bottles of vodka into a plastic cup. He sprays Binaca in his mouth. Then, careful to look both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank. 50. 50. Blomkvist approaches a desk.       The brass name plate on it reads, Anita Vanger. Excuse me. I'm sure I should have made an appointment. It's fine.    Please.     Have a seat. The accent is all British. She's been here much longer than her home country. No trace of Swedish anymore. He offers his hand - I'm Mikael. Mikael.   How do you do. As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ... You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael? I would if had any money to invest. Excuse me? I'm writing a biography of your uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here. She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia predicted, but it doesn't come. They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk. How is Henrik? Good.   Engaging. I like him. She does, too. 51. 51. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ  52. 52. I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy. She never confided in you what about, specifically? There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it. What do you think happened to her? Everyone knows what. But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who. All I know is I always felt sorry for her. Even more than for myself. I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back. She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18. Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects. Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth Salander.  ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed our appointment. I had a lot of work ... no, nothing to be concerned about ... I need another advance on my allowance. Can I come to your office tonight? ... I don't need a pen, what's the address? 53. 53. The taxi that first brought him here to the island, crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror. Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button. As she waits, she notes there's no security camera. Yes? It's me. The door buzzes.     She pushes it open. She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread. Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe. Come on in. She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door. Like it? It's nice. It's home.  So, what do you need money for this time? Grand Theft Auto 5? Food. He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin. How are you? Been thinking about last time? Decided you wanted to see me again? 54. 54. I just want my money. Well, let's see if I can help you out with that. He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed. Wait. She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair. Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to. Is there a problem? I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat? It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out. He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness. She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her underwear. Please.   I have neighbors. He lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age music. What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money. He watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere. He tears open a condom package with his teeth. 55. 55. I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex? He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life; it's the only place to go in such situations. The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear. He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews: Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible ... He sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is depressing. Dawn light outside the living room window. Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange juice, writing out a check. In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket, shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room. I'll drive you home. I can get home on my own. Are you sure? It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman. So, next Saturday, here? 56. 56. She nods.   Leaves.   The door closes. A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets. She sets a check down. On the memo line he's neatly written, "for food." She takes a bottle of water from the fridge and drinks. Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder blade and runs down past several others. By the time the water reaches the drain it has turned red. Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist sees a BMW parked outside his cottage. Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window. A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers it a crack. Is it any warmer inside? No. As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk. What have I missed besides you? The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers. Seriously? Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat? 57. 57. I'm not.   I'm working. I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top. Would you like to meet him? Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested. He is. Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her. I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. We'll work through them. Are you sure? Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this. How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? That sounds about right.  You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. We still own one. The Courier, here in town. 58. 58. I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. So what do you say to taking on a partner? We've never considered it before. We value our independence. Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content. Excuse me.   Did I miss something? We're talking about an investment in the magazine. I gather.    Why would you want to do that? Not for the return, that's for sure.  I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason. And. The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. So what do you say? 59. 59. Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it. Is that a maybe? She nods. Wonderful!   More wine, Anna. Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger. I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way. Have you seen him try to make a fire? Put the logs on end, like this. He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying. Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace. How long have you been discussing this with them? I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday. Why didn't you tell me? Why would I.   You live in the woods. So I deserve to be treated like an idiot? I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea. 60. 60. You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three. You don't know this family.   They're crazy. We're not marrying into it. We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing. You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up, comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom. He stares at the fire. Mikael? What. I'm leaving this God-forsaken island in the morning. So? So are you coming to bed or not. Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers. You thinking one arm or both? Wrists and ankles. But none of these. Just a plain band, like handcuffs. 61. 61. It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt. That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun. How much do one of those cost? A bland financial announcer reading the news. The graphic to the side of him is the distinctive V.I. logo of Vanger Industries. Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger Industries has acquired a controlling interest in Millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last December when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom - A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office, where a reporter interviews her - We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step. You wouldn't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist? That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical. Where. I'm not sure, to be honest with you. He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared. 62. 62. They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted the approximate time of day of each. The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by family members of each other. The next couple taken in town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and glances out to see a television news van driving toward Vanger's manor - A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on. Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us. Is any magazine really undervalued today. How many will be around tomorrow? There's another reason.      I don't like bullies. Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom? I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back. You're enjoying this. Already it's the most fun I've had in years. As a clerk rings up the   items Salander is buying - bright yellow duct tape   and a plastic protective mask - she watches a shot on a   TV here of Wennerstrom being interviewed outside his   offices - 63. 63. I've always admired Henrik Vanger. He's a titan - and a gentleman. But he's also quite old now - which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar. The report segues to another story.     The clerk hands Salander her receipt. Her hardware store purchases, along with some fresh DVD- R's, a couple of plastic bottles of ink, and McDonald's Kids Meal wrappers, sit by her laptop. She's not typing on its keyboard, but characters are appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else, writes an email: The From box reads:   h wennerstrom The To box reads:   l jansson 116   INT. COTTAGE - DAY - CONTINUED                             116
