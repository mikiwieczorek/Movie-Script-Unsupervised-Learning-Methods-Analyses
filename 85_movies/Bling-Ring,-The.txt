A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of prescription pills and dumps them in a bag. We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags. Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it. The kids exit with their hoods up, carrying out the Louis Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry. The kids make their get-away: One girl, NICKI leans over and throws-up on their way out. They get into the Toyota and peel out. Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive teenagers and news clips. We see a clip of black & white video surveillance of the kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.

Slow motion- MARC, 16, stylish and good looking, dressed in a black suit and sunglasses, walks outside the courthouse like a movie star flanked by paparazzi. Music and titles end on: NICKI, 17, pretty brunette with long hair, sunglasses and lip gloss talks to a reporter:  I am a firm believer in Karma, and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I see myself being like an Angelina Jolie, but even stronger, pushing even harder for the universe and peace and for the health of the planet.

Title: 1 year earlier Nicki and Sam, also pretty, slutty and 17, are waking up in a messy teenage bedroom. Clothes are all over the floor, a knot of duvet covers part of a girl, with legs sticking out, we can see a lotus blossom tattoo.  5. Girls, time to get up! Oh my lord, you were so out of control last night. What about you! You were all over that old guy, the manager... Oh yeah. He was totally perving out. Girls! Time for your aderall! Let's go! Mom, they got home so late last night. That's none of your concern, I'll handle it. Girls!  6. What time did you get home last night? Uh...late. You know it's a school night. We know... Let's have our morning prayer and then we'll meet in the living room at eight to start today's lesson on the laws of attraction, OK? My chief aim in life is to continually strive to express my greatest potential as a spiritual human being and contributor to the greater good for our planet and all those who live on it. I know that I have the ability to reach my aim in life, by persistent action and that the thoughts of my mind will reproduce themselves in outward physical reality. I will channel my energy towards my aim in life with graciousness and loving kindness to myself and others. And so it is. Wahoo! 7. Marc gets dressed for school. He looks at himself in the mirror, anxious to start a new school. He gets his things together. Marc is being dropped off by his mom, Debbie in a modest car. Kids are entering school for the day. They're the burn out kids. Have a great day. Thanks. I hope you like it here. It always takes a little time to get settled in. Yeah. Ok, thanks, Mom. He heads in to school. As he walks up, he can feel kids looking at him. He sees bunches of kids in groups checking him out. Marc enters the full classroom. He looks for a seat, kids stare at the new kid. A Mexican Goth girl glares at him as he finds a seat in the back. The students all look like rejects. The bell rings and kids come out of their classes.  8. I can't believe it, someone hacked into my account and changed my password to cheeze it. No way, that sucks. Watch it. Hey, new kid. You got Shamus for English? Yeah. He's the worst. He's a real perv. Oh ok, I'll watch out, thanks. Where you headed? Gym, where's that? It's down here... Where are you from?  9. Agoura Hills, but I was away for a year, did home school... Bummer. How'd you end up in the drop-out school? I got kicked out of the last school for too many absences. What about you? For having `substances' you're not suppose to have at school. See you later. Hey, you want to come to the beach after school? Yeah, sure.  10. I just have to graduate, so I can go to F.I.D.M. - Fashion Institute of Design, the Hills girls all went there. Cool, and then intern at Teen Vogue? Totes...and then have my own line, and fragrance, host a show... Yeah, I'd like to have my own lifestyle brand. Definitely. Yo wassup, Chloe. Yo, Bitch. You going to Karly's later? Maybe. Ok, see you. Lates. My mom and her douchey husband are out of town, if you guys want to come over later? 11. Music is playing. Kids roam around with beers. Some kid is smoking out of a big bong, and singing along to a hip hop chorus. In a bedroom, Rebecca's older sister SARAH, 19, is selling little baggies of coke. It's Fifty. Oh c'mon. You want it or not? She dangles the baggie like a treat. He takes it. Sucker. Fuck off. There's a bulletin board of fashion tears and pictures of young starlets- Rachel Bilson, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina Patridge, some Victoria Secret models. Rebecca smokes a cigarette, while she and Marc flip through magazines. They look at pages of starlets in gowns on the red carpet. In the background, the TV is on with random celebrity culture playing There's a page of `Tweets of the Week' including a picture of Demi Moore posing in a bikini in her bathroom. I can't wait to get out of here. Is your mom away a lot? Yeah, she goes on trips a lot for work...  12. For what? She has a chain of student tutoring centers... And you're at Indian Hills? Yeah, I know, exemplary student... That's so cute, I love that dress. I love Chanel. She points at a picture. Yeah, and the shoes are nice...but she needs to get some better extensions... I know, right? Are those Prada? No, Dior. Really?   Hey, what do your parents do? My mom doesn't work, my dad works for a film distribution company, they do a lot of stuff overseas.. Oh cool, he's in the `biz'.. Yeah...it's cool. I get to go to screenings and stuff. Nice...oh she's so cute. But enough with the patent leather accessories, they look cheap. Yeah, totes...  13. She smiles. Kids hang around drinking and smoking, some jump in the pool. Hey, wanna check some cars? What's that?  C'mon... They walk out the gate. Marc and Rebecca are on an affluent suburban street. They walk down the sidewalk casually under the street lights. Rebecca checks to see if a car's door is open. It's not, she goes on to another. She opens the door of a Lexus, and finds a small purse in door side pocket, she takes it. Sweet. C'mon. They keep walking and she tries another few cars, until she finds another open door. She looks around and finds some cash and a credit card. No way! Let's go. And they head back casually, and cut off into some bushes. That's crazy.  14. Yeah, people leave them open with cash and credit cards... They walk off into the darkness, smoking cigarettes. Look, we got like 400 bucks... They disappear into the night. Marc walks out of school to see Rebecca leaning against her car waiting for him. Want a ride? She has a sly Cheshire cat smile. He smiles and gets in. They drive in the valley. I love that mix you sent me. Oh, cool, anytime... Where are we going? Wherever we want... She lifts and eyebrow. Okay. Do you know anyone that's out of town? Uh, this kid Evan I met online, their family went to Jamaica, why?  15. I went into an unlocked house a few weeks ago and found a bunch of cash....where does `Evan' live? Woodland hills.  How well do you know `Evan'? We met up a few times...he was pretty hot. He smiles mischievously. They pull up to a nice suburban house. This it? Uh huh. They walk up casually. They go around to the back of the house and find a side door open. Marc follows Rebecca in. Rebecca casually looks around, opening drawers, sitting on the furniture. Marc paces nervously. Fuck...I think we should get outta here. Rebecca keeps looking through cabinets and drawers calmly. It's fine, it's fine...don't freak out. She goes down a hall, Marc nervously follows her. In a bedroom, Rebecca opens the closet and tries on a jacket.  16. What do you think? It's Balenciaga Uh, Sure. He can't really focus. She gets down on the floor and looks under the bed. She pulls out a box, and opens it. Oh, yeah. What is it. She pulls out a thick stack of cash and smiles. No way! Rebecca gets in a Porsche convertible in the driveway like it's hers and starts the engine. What the fuck? Rebecca smiles, and flips her sunglasses from her head, over her eyes, as she lowers the roof. Get in. Marc gets in. Where'd you get the keys?  I grabbed them on the way out. She backs out of the driveway like it's no big deal. Hey, call my sister for a bag, will you, she won't sell to me.  17. She peels out. How long's Evan in Jamaica? They drive off, blasting music, their hair blowing. Rebecca and Marc strut down the street with big sunglasses on, carrying Starbucks and shopping bags. They go in to Kitson. Marc and Rebecca shop like pros. They're having the time of their lives, styling each other and picking stuff out. They check out their looks in the mirror, and take pictures. They take two small boxes out of a Tiffany & Co. bag and put on matching rings. At the cashier they put a big pile of stuff on the counter. They speed off in Evan's car, music blasting. Marc looks at Rebecca, her hair blowing in the wind. Rebecca smiles at him. Music plays as Valley kids hang out, smoke pot, play beer- pong. Chloe saunters by. Chloe, marry me!  18. Get in line. She walks up to Rebecca and Marc Beccaaaaaa! Yo, slut we're going to Les Deux, wanna go? Nicki and Sam are there. Rebecca looks at Marc. Sure. Chloe talks her way in with the cute Mexican door man, ROB. Marc follows Rebecca and her. Chloe already seems a little drunk. Yo, Rob, what's up? Hey, Chloe - Come on in. Is Ricky here? Yeah, he should be around. Marc and Rebecca are at a table with Nicki and Sam who are dressed in skimpy outfits and lots of lip gloss. Nicki, re-applies lip gloss, as Sam sends a text. The music is loud and they shout to speak to each other. out.) Marc is feeling in his element, this is where he should be.  19. Chloe sits down, holding some drinks. Yo, sluts. Nicki leans over to meet Marc. Chlooeeee! `sup...this is my homie, Marc. Hi, I'm Nicki and this is Sam. Hey, Marc. We used to go to school together. Are they sisters? They've known each other since they were like three, they took Sam in, I don't know what happened to her mom. Oh my god, Jude Law totally keeps texting me...I think I'm probably going to go meet him later. Yeah, I'm sure you're really going to hesitate on that one. Sam chuckles. Bitch, you're just jealous. Suck my dick. You did text him like fifty times. I did not.  20. Chloe laughs. Marc looks around at the glamorous people, he's thinking this is the life. C'mon Chloe, where's that bottle service? Let's get that going. Across the room, a blonde starlet air kisses the D.J. RICKY, 45, the sleazy club promoter stops by their table. Girls. Chloe gets up and throws herself around him. Ricky! Hey, baby, you good? You guys have everything you need? Uh huh. Nicki, there are some photographers out here for fashion week you might want to meet. Fo' sho! And this dope music manager, and some of the entourage producers- we've got a real party salad tonight. An actor, with some friends and a few models, sit nearby. Ok, let me know if you need anything...  I'll check with you later, Boo.  21. And whispers something naughty in to his ear. He smiles and moves on. Marc spots Paris Hilton across the room. Oh my god, that's Paris Hilton. Yeah, totally, she DJs sometimes... We see Ricky by a booth near the DJ where Paris Hilton and friends sit with a big bottle of Moet-Chandon. Nicki, Sam and Chloe dance - Nicki and Sam do a sexy sister act, throwing their hair around. Sam gives Rob, the door guy, a flirty look. Marc and Rebecca chill in their booth looking around the room like this is it. He takes a picture of them together. The computer screen fills the frame as we see Marc updating his page with a photo of him and the girls hanging out in the nightclub booth. Marc lies on his bed thinking about his cool new friends and lifestyle, a little smile goes across his lips. Marc struts up to school. Rebecca, Chloe and some kids hanging out meet him and they go in together. I literally thought I was going to die.  22. Homie... Yo, bitches. Dawg, wassup? Marc hands Rebecca a Starbucks. I thought you might want one. Oh, you're the best. Marc smiles. I love your shirt. Thanks. Marc looks over at Rebecca as they walk into school. Marc's P.O.V. - we see Rebecca move in slow motion, the wind blows her sunlit hair. I loved her, I really did. She was the first person I felt like was my best friend...I loved her almost as a sister, that's what made this situation so hard. T.V. screen: Victoria Secret models preening down a runway fill the screen. Marc and Rebecca hang out in her room, looking at magazines and stuff on the computer. The Victoria Secret show is on the TV in the background. Marc is looking at a gossipy website. We see on screen: TMZ news of Mischa Barton DUI arrest and mug shot.  23.  Misha Barton got a DUI...Paris Hilton is hosting a party Thursday night at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas... Where does she live, can you find her house? Marc types onto the computer. 2342 Briar Summit... He pulls up a Google Maps image of her house, they're able to look around it. Rebecca's eyes light up. Let's go there! Do you think we could find a way in? Looks like you could get in going up the hill behind her house. I bet she'd leave her keys under her mat. We see over Marc and Rebecca's dark figures, Paris' mansion glowing up on a hill. crystal pink Eiffel Tower key ring. Rebecca and Marc open the door with the key and go in. 24. They walk in the quiet house and turn on the light, as little spider monkeys in a cage jump toward them and screech. Rebecca and Marc jump back, he yells. Rebecca glares at him to be cool. Oh my fucking god. They're her pet monkeys. Hi guys. She leans forward and makes a cute face at the monkey who hisses at her. They continue through the house looking around. They pass a gilded gold-framed couch with pillows with Paris' photo silk screened on them. They pass a wall of photos of Paris Hilton and her many magazine covers, as they go upstairs. Marc is nervous, Rebecca is cool and focused. He paces and is on the look out, while she looks for stuff. Let's get the fuck out of here. It's fine, it's fine...let's keep going. They go into her dressing area. It's a mess, clothes all over the floor. Rebecca picks up some small purses and finds crumpled fifties and hundred dollar bills that she takes. She's so messy. Rebecca looks through her underwear drawer, takes a bright pink bra. She takes a Louis Vuitton Camo bag and stuffs some things in it. Rebecca sits on her bed, and looks around. Marc paces nervously.  25. C'mon, let's get out of here. You're tripping out. This is fine, it's ok, why are you tripping out? Rebecca casually descends the stairs as if she lives there. Marc follows her down, into Paris' night club room. There are pictures of her all over the walls, and a stripper pole on a little platform. Pink furry pillows line the banquette. Marc takes a bottle of vodka. Rebecca looks around the room, takes it all in. They leave, closing the door behind them. They see a security patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes. The patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes. Rebecca and Marc freeze in their hiding spot. Marc is freaking out, he thinks this is it for him. He tries to breath quietly. Rebecca calmly waits. Finally the flashing lights stop, and the car moves on. Marc and Rebecca sit in the dark, Marc breaths again. They wait for a while. C'mon. They sneak out through the backyard, and run down a hill behind the house. Oh my fucking god. We see them as small figures running across the empty hillside. Kids hang out, and drink on a tennis court.  26. Rebecca and Marc are with Chloe, Nicki and Sam. No way, I totally want to go to Paris'! Yeah, it was sweet, we hung out in her night club room...I got this. She shows them a sparkly diamond tennis bracelet. Oh my god, no way. You are so sick! O.G. Motherfucker! Rebecca laughs, and cheers Marc with their plastic cups. No way, how'd you get in? Her key was under the mat, it was so chill, we just walked in. We can all go back, we just have to check when she's going out to something... A computer screen: Photo of Paris Hilton on gossip website that says "Paris hosting Skyy vodka party at LIV in Miami". Nicki, Sam and Rebecca try on outfits for Marc, he helps style them, while he's looking online, telling them celebrity tidbits. Nicki and Sam love taking their tops off... Lindsay got another D.U.I... Here try this vest with that... We see some news footage of Lindsay Lohan with cops on computer screen.  27. Nicki shows Marc an outfit - tight jeans and a vest. What do you think? Try your hair back. She pulls her hair back, and poses for him. Yeah, that looks classy. I don't know if I'd go that far. Sam puts on a skimpy leopard dress and zebra pumps. Nicki looks at her. Leopard and Zebra - seriously? What? Yeah, def, you can't wear zebra and leopard. You have to choose one. Ok, fine....at least I don't look like I'm thirty-five. Sam blows smoke from a joint out the window. Nicki is entranced with herself as she puts lip gloss on in the mirror. Someone hands her a joint. Let's go to Paris', c'mon, She takes a drag-pause and then exhales. I want to rob... Nicki sits at a table with a tape recorder in front of her. She's dressed like a school girl.  28.  I didn't know what they were doing. I thought they were my friends...it all comes back to bad choices, who you have as your friends, and I know the truth will come out. Nicki, Sam, Chloe and Marc follow Rebecca as they sneak up and go in the house. Rebecca opens the door with the key, the bejeweled charm dangling from the key ring. Sam and Nicki look at each other impressed, and they follow her in. They follow Rebecca into Paris' dressing area. No way! Rebecca opens a closet door and there's a room full of shoes. No fucking way. That's so chill. Look at all her Louboutins. Her feet are big. Nicki and Sam start trying shoes on and grabbing bags. They take photos of themselves with outfits on in her closet. Sam finds a note and reads it out loud.  29. "Ciao Paris, Keep the glamour alive! Un Bacio, Donatella." Marc puts on a pair of pink heels and runway walks for the girls who love it. He grabs a little LV rolling suitcase, and does a runway look with it coming around a corner, pulling the suitcase in heels and a scarf like a `60s Pan Am stewardess. Rebecca notices something on the far wall of the closet and pushes on the back wall of shoes - the wall opens to a secret safe room. Sweet. There's an open safe and Rebecca and Marc get down to see what's in it, they find cash, some jewelry and naked photos. Look at these! We could sell these. Let me see! Oh shit! What's all over her? Some bad tanner... Back in closet area: Nicki tries on a pink mini dress, and shows it to them. What do you think? It's Herve Leger. Sam and Chloe scream. What?! Sam's holding a Louis Vuitton dog carrier.  30. There's actually an old dog turd in here. Ew, put that back. Nicki grabs a big bag and throws some stuff in it, and walks around with it swinging from her wrist like it's hers and she's out shopping. Rebecca is filling a bag, too... and looking through her drawers. Rebecca opens a pink make-up bag and starts putting on Paris' make-up. She opens the medicine cabinet. She looks through some prescriptions and takes a bottle. She puts on some of Paris' pink lipstick and pouts in the mirror. C'mon let's get the fuck out of here. Alright, alright...in a sec. They take some more stuff and head down the stairs laughing. Oh wait, you have to see her night club room. The kids make themselves at home. Sam and Nicki goof off on the stripper pole. Chloe makes herself a cocktail. Rebecca flicks on some party light setting and lounges on a sofa with some pillows with Paris' face on them. Marc paces nervously.  31. Sam is filming Nicki with her phone, she mugs and talks to the camera. Ciao! We see Nicki on Sam's phone. Keep the glamour alive! Sam and Nicki take pictures of themselves with a life size Paris cut-out. Laughing, they run down the hill behind the house. Rebecca, Marc, Chloe and Nicki are having a great time on a busy night at the club. Nicki's wearing a pink mini-dress dress she stole from Paris'. The others are decked out in stuff they got from there as well. Some of them are dancing. In a hallway, Sam is making out with the hot Mexican door guy, Rob. Chloe's driving wasted, with Rebecca and Marc in the car. They're blasting music, high from their night. -Suddenly Chloe crashes into another car, air bags go off in their faces, with that awful sound of a car crash.  32. They sit there silent, flashing police lights flood the car as a siren blares. Flashes go off as Chloe gets mug shots taken. She has her toughest face on. Rebecca and Marc hang out in front of school while Chloe brags about how hard core she is. Man, I was off the charts, it was craaazzay - they didn't know how I was driving let alone still alive. That's fucked up. Yeah, I have to pick up trash for fucking forever... That sucks... What are you guys doing later? I don't know, there's a party at Madison's...I'll let you know, lates. Marc's feeling good, listening to music and putting outfits together in his room, American Gigolo style, laying out combinations on his bed, holding things up in the mirror.  33. He gets a text on his phone and looks at it: LET'S GO TO Rebecca and Marc hang out like it's their place. They listen to music on the club professional sound system. Marc opens a drawer and finds diamond encrusted gun lighter. He leans over and lights Rebecca's cigarette. She smokes and they look through her stuff. The dog sits next to her. As Marc and Rebecca are leaving, the Yorkie sees them out. Rebecca picks up the little dog and starts to leave with it. C'mon Teacup. You can't take her dog. She likes me...and I could probably get like five hundred for her. Marc looks at her like she's too much. Come on Rebecca, leave her dog, it would be too noticeable anyway. Yeah, I guess... bye Teacup. She sets the little yorkie down, and they hit the lights. Revised Blue - 03/16/12            34. As they leave, Rebecca checks a door handle of an expensive sports car on the street. It opens, and she reaches in a door pocket. Shut the fuck up. She holds up a big bag of coke and smiles. Oh shit. Rebecca and Marc drive around singing along to their favorite song, high, having the best time of their lives. When the song ends, they play it again...and again. They take bumps and keep going. The music fades down and off hearts out). We were acting insane, but it all felt so glamorous and wonderful. Coverage of The Hills 3 premier. There are clips of              * celebrities posing on the red carpet as flashes go off in front of a backdrop with LG logos and other sponsors. We see a blonde, with a hand on hip pose, then she turns and look at the cameras over her shoulder. Then there's an interview with reality T.V. star, Audrina Patridge:                                                        * What are your favorite hot spots in L.A.?  Revised Blue - 03/16/12               35. Hot spots? Well, we love Lola's, we go there all the time, it's a Martini bar, and I like the Dime, and we always go to Les Deux, cause all our friends are always there...it's like the spot to go to. So have you toned down the partying since you have a boyfriend?...  Uh, well, sure, a little... Rebecca and Marc are watching The Hills premier on TV. Marc is also looking at stuff on a laptop. His screen is filled with shots of Audrina Patridge in            * different looks at various events. She's in a bikini in one, a sexy dress, a skimpy naughty Halloween costume. Oh my god, I literally love Audrina's style...can you see where she lives? Marc types in her name and a few things, and before you know it he has a photo and map of her house up on the screen. She's going to Demi & Ashton's Oscar party Sunday. Rebecca smiles. Perfect. 36. In a wide shot, we see Rebecca and Marc as small figures enter a glass house on a hill. They run around and leave with bags of stuff. Rebecca, Marc, Sam and Nicki are looking through clothes. There are piles of bags and designer clothes on Rebecca's bed. Nicki and Sam are squealing and trying things on, Marc is styling them, and taking pictures of them posing in their `looks'. Nicki puts on some crazy Louboutins. He tells them how great they look. Nicki and Sam dance in front of the computer screen watching as they film themselves. Marc goofs off around dancing with them, acting like a big- shot pimp flanked by his girls. We see targeting in on a Tudor house in the hills, the camera zooms in and shows side views, next to a map. Rebecca, Marc and Chloe approach a house with their hoods on. Nicki, Sam and Emily join them. Rebecca looks over at Emily. Wait. Who are you? This is my little sister, Emily. Oh. How old are you?  37. Thirteen. She looks at her like "old enough". C'mon. They look around, trying doors and windows. Rebecca finds a dog door at the back of the house. Can you fit through there? Emily crawls through, opening a door for the others to come in. I'm staying on look-out. The kids go through the closets and drawers, Rebecca opens a suitcase on the floor - it's filled with jeans and t-shirts. Nicki looks in the closet. I like this Rick Owens jacket. Nicki throws on the leather jacket, and keeps going. Marc hears a sound outside. Did you hear that? It's fine, it's fine. I think I heard someone. There's no one outside, calm the fuck down. I hear helicopters.  38. We're in L.A., there are always helicopters...don't be such a little bitch. Rebecca pulls some designer bags off a shelf, as if she hit a jack pot. Sam looks through racks of clothes as if she's in a boutique. Emily tries on shoes. Ew, what are these oils for? Gross. Sam looks through the medicine cabinet and grabs a handful of prescription bottles. She reads the labels, tossing anything uninteresting. What's Alprazolam? Nicki answers from the other room. Xanax. Oh good... She drops it in her bag. Marc loads up a bag, and paces around, on the look-out. Jesus Christ, let's hurry the fuck up. Nicki approaches the bed in the master bedroom, and lies down on it, feeling what it feels like, looking around. She picks up a picture in a silver frame and looks at a couple on the beach: Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green. Nicki rolls over and off the bed, looking under it, she finds a box, and opens it to find a gun.  39. She picks up the gun. Look what I found! Let me see that. Sam starts dancing with the gun, waving it around. Oh shit, be careful with that thing. Is it loaded? Sam raises it to her lips teasingly. Maybe. The kids run past the glittery view. Sam throws her head out the car window and screams in an adrenaline rush. Rob, from the club, is asleep in his bed in the small dark room. Sam climbs in through a window into his room, back-lit from a street lamp. He looks over and sees Sam dancing around for him in jean cut- offs with the gun. She climbs on him in bed, and drags the gun over him, he grabs her and throws her under him, the gun in her hand goes off and fires a bullet into his closet. Dogs start barking, and we hear a voice call.  40. ROB'S MOTHER  Robert? What's going on? It's nothing, Mom. gun. them. She disappears under the sheets. Laurie is bringing out a foam board with magazine photos collaged on to it. She's wearing a tight tank top with an Indian symbol and brown velour sweat pants. Girls, time for school! Sam, Nicki and Emily come sit on the coach with sari fabric thrown over it and ethnic-looking pillows. Nicki flips up her Ray-bans slowly. Sam has messy hair, she looks like she got home late. She's eating a bowl of cereal, Nicki's on her Blackberry. The room is filled with Buddha statues and Balinese wood carved furniture and candles. The girls are flipping through magazines. Put the phone away...ok you guys, today's lesson is about character development. In "The Secret" we talk about the law of attraction and we want to be careful about the people we surround ourselves with because we become the average of those people. So we're going to make a visual board of people who are demonstrating good character, like Angelina Jolie. So what are some qualities you admire about her?  41. Her husband. The girls chuckle. Ok. What else? Her hot bod. Ok, the bod is not a characteristic. How long do we have to do this for? Until we're finished with this and then we're going to do some flower essence work. The door bell rings, and Nicki goes to answer it. A young guy delivering water, comes in with big bottles. Who is it? Water delivery. Nicki poses against wall as he passes, flirtatiously. Laurie zips up Nicki's hoodie that's showing off her cleavage. Ok, back to work. We see news caption: Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie in New York, He's with Victoria-Secret model/girlfriend, Miranda Kerr.  42. Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie in New York, he's there with Miranda Kerr. There's a picture of the actor and model on the red carpet. Then we see typed in: Orlando Bloom's address. A map comes up. I want to get some Victoria Secret model clothes.  Let's do it. The gang of them approach a fence, there's some wire fence at the bottom that's unraveling, they pull on it and it opens enough for them to squeeze through. They approach the house and scatter around to find a way in. Rebecca opens the front door, it's unlocked. You guys. They follow her in. They sneak into the bedroom and start looking through stuff. The girls go through a woman's closet, trying on clothes, grabbing stuff. Marc opens a drawer in a closet, and finds seven Rolex watches and a thick stack of hundred dollar bills. He scoops them into a bag.  43. We see a high-tech security camera globe in ceiling, a red light turns on. Rebecca hangs out on a sofa smoking a cigarette, while she looks through a box of photos and trinkets, as if she's at home. As they're headed out with all of their loot, Rebecca grabs a piece of art off the wall. What the fuck are you doing? I've got a new room at my Dad's in Vegas, I need some stuff to decorate it, I might stay with him a while...here, hold this. She hands him the art off the wall, and rolls up a little rug on the floor. Are you fucking serious? Rebecca gives him a nonchalant look, and takes it out with her under her arm, carrying a big bag on her other side. Marc watches her and follows her out. We see their P.O.V. out the windshield on the dark street, headlights illuminating their way. It's quiet in the car. If I ever became not your friend anymore, would you rob me? I would never do that to you. 44. We see Leighton Meister close up and in slow-motion, atmospheric music from scene before continues over the image. Rachel Bilson and Nicole Ritchie sitting at the front row of a fashion show on fashion T.V. watching models go by. Kim and Kourtney Kardashian trying out a stripper pole at home on their reality show. Lindsay Lohan in a skimpy dress exiting a club. Rebecca is entranced watching a Golden Globes red carpet re- cap on the T.V. We see styled starlet after starlet pose for cameras, they put their hands on their hips, and do over the shoulder looks to cameras as flashes go off. Amanda Seyfried, Anne Hathaway, Blake Lively, Kim Kardashian... A journalist interviews a starlet. Who are you wearing? I'm wearing Armani Privee. And the jewelry? My jewelry is by Chopard. And what about your shoes? Louboutins.  45. Well, you look beautiful, are you excited for tonight? Thank you, yes, I'm so excited to be here. And she moves on, and another starlet talks about her outfit. Alone in his room, Marc pulls a drawer out from under his bed- it's filled with designer clothes and bags. He just looks at it all and touches it. We see him lying on the bed, with a fur vest as a pillow, and stuff out, wearing Paris Hilton's pink patent leather heels. There's a knock at the door. Marc? Oh one second, Mom. He scrambles to puts it all away quickly. It's time for dinner. Ok, I'll be right there. He stuffs things back under the bed, and makes a call on his cell. Hey, Chloe. Yo Home Skillet, what's going on? Did you talk to Ricky about the Rolexes.  46. Yeah, yeah, he's got connects, bring them by later. It's dinner at their house- with Laurie saying grace. Her boyfriend, HENRY sits next to her and Sam, Nicki and Emily are at the table. Laurie bows her head. We look to the universe and Divine Spirit to show us the way. I am so grateful for this opportunity to have dinner together as a family. And so it is. And so it is. Laurie takes a sip of white wine, and passes a plate. So, how did your audition go? It was alright. I think it went really well, they said they want to do a test shoot. That's good, that's good. What's it for? Axe body spray. Uh huh. And we have a go-see for the BCBG runway show!  47. Great! That's a cute top, is that new? Nicki's shirt has a Chanel logo on it. Oh, yeah, our friend Marc, he's a stylist, he let us borrow some stuff for the auditions. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, his dad has a production company he helps style for. Oh, what's it called? I don't remember. Something -international? Mom, can I be excused? Are you done? Yeah, and I want to finish my flower essences. Ok, sweetie. I'm thinking about doing a silent retreat. Good luck. Sam and Nicki chuckle. I think that's great, honey.  48. Uh, Mom, we have to get going, we're meeting this manager tonight who could be really helpful. Yeah, He knows a lot of photographers...and producers. OK, OK, that sounds good. Just be back by eleven. Uh huh. She laughs. The girls get up from the table. Yeah, right. Eleven. It's a week night.  Eleven my ass. Nicki and Sam are cracking themselves up in their underwear, smoking a joint, exhaling out the window and picking out slutty outfits. They check themselves out in a full length mirror. I know, I'd totally do him....but did you see how small his hands are? Ew, no. Yeah, that could be gross.  49. Yeah. Dude, we have to get in that video...Does this look good? Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in that? I just want to look hot, but not desperate. Totally. I think you look hot. Let me see a different top... She slips on a silky camisole, and turns in her tight jeans. We can see a lower-back tatoo peeking out. Does my butt look good in these jeans? Your butt looks awesome. compliment) Marc follows Chloe into Ricky's private office. Ricky hangs out, leaning back in a chair. Ricky, you remember Marc. Sure, sure I do. Come on in, Marc. What can I do for you. Marc opens a bag on his desk with the pile of Rolexes.  50. Ricky looks at him with a poker face. Can you sell these? Ricky chuckles. Where'd you get them? Uh...I found them. I see. He enjoys dragging this out, making Marc squirm. What do you think, can you take them? I don't know...I can see...tell you what, I'll give you five grand for them. Aren't they worth more? Not stolen ones. Ok, yeah. Thanks. Sure, kid. He smiles and goes to his safe. Marc and Nicki snort coke off the back of a little clutch bag on the back of the toilet. 51. Chloe straddles Ricky on his desk chair, making out with him. She holds out her arm and takes a picture on her phone. A little blackberry flash hits them, with her in a slutty pose up next to him. Marc and the girls, all done up sit in a booth and get bottle service. A big bottle of vodka is brought over. Marc and the girls dance in slightly slow-motion. We hear dreamy, almost ominous tonal music as they dance instead of the club music. They sway in a dreamy trance, light gleaming around them, outlining their hair. When we went out, we got in everywhere and everyone loved us...and we had so many beautiful, gorgeous things. Marc is stashing a bunch of his loot in a basement. We see him take a last look at a Louis Vuitton suitcase packed full of luxury bags and designer fashion. Quilted Chanel bags in every color, Louboutin patent leather platform heels, Marc Jacobs crisp shirts. He touches them, and makes sure they're all tucked away carefully, before closing it up. We see there are several Louis Vuitton suitcases, he slides this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the corner and leaves them by some old Christmas decorations.  52. He turns off the light and heads up the stairs. Marc's little old grandma shuffles about in a house coat with a plate of cookies, as he rushes out. Bye, Grandma. He gives her a kiss on his way out. Bye now. He shuts the door. In the bright light, Marc, Rebecca, Sam, Chloe and Nicki strut down the street with big sunglasses, lattes and shopping bags...just like reality stars. They are have a more jaded attitude now. The kids plus Rob enter the house. Rebecca leads them in as if it's her place. Rebecca lounges in her bedroom, as the other girls try on things. Sam puts on a skimpy top and shows Nicki. Sexy biatch. Nicki looks in a mirror as she tries on a fluffy white fur jacket. J'adore Dior.  53. The girls are wearing Paris' jewelry and they're hanging out, making drinks as if they live there. One of them's in a fur vest. How many times have you guys been up here? I think this is like the 5th time. And she never noticed? We never take enough for it to be obvious...and c'mon, it's Paris Hilton. She's so messy. I know, right? Rob opens drawers, until he finds a box full of jewelry. He pulls out some diamond necklaces. Here we go. Oh, shit. The other kids gather around, as he holds them up. C'mon, let's get the fuck out of here. Marc styles Nicki, dressing her up in a look. Or you could wear the Chloe sandals with this.  54. Oh, yeah. Nicki smokes something off a little piece of tin foil, exhaling out the window. His phone rings. Turn on KTLA. What? Now. Marc turns on the TV and finds the channel- to see news footage of them from a surveillance camera sneaking into Audrina Patridge's house. He freaks out. No fucking way, no fucking way. Calm the fuck down, they can't tell who it is. Oh my god. He starts crying. Oh, shit. It's fine, it's fine, you can't see who it is. On TV: Audrina Patridge posted this on her web site, asking for anyone who has any information about the break-in to contact police at the number below. Oh my god.  55. He stumbles and knocks something over that makes a loud crashing noise. There's a knock on the door. Oh shit. Nicki cracks the door open coyly. Marc's dad who looks like a teamster looks at her. MR. HALL Is everything alright in there? Yes, Mr. Hall, sorry if we're making too much noise. Marc calls out. Everything's fine. MR. HALL OK. Nicki smiles and shuts the door. We see the surveillance   video being viewed, it's rewound and studied on a loop. They   zoom in and the grainy image fills the frame as we see the   kids entering and leaving with loot. They zoom in and freeze   on a face. It's late at night, the lights are off, Marc looks up at the ceiling, he's tired, but can't sleep. Rebecca, Marc and Chloe hang out sitting on rocks, smoking.  56. It's beautiful there, with a water fall that some kids jump off of, and stoner kids hanging around. The rocks are covered in graffiti. I'll probably go over to Sagebrush later... Cool, who's playing? I don't know, I think some local bands... Rebecca checks a text. I want to go to Rachel Bilson's, she's in Paris for fashion week. Don't you think you should chill out a little bit? Yeah, that news thing totally freaked me out. Nothing happened, there's no way you can tell who that is...C'mon, will you find her house for me, please? She gives him a pleading baby pouty look. I want some Chanel... I don't know. C'mon, you're my best friend, please. Let's go get some stuff. 57. Rebecca drives and talks on speaker phone with Marc next to her. We're going to Rachel Bilson's, wanna come? Hells yeah, text me where...is she still dating Hayden Christensen? I don't know. Marc nods. Marc thinks so. Marc does a bump. We follow Rebecca, Marc, Nicki, and Sam as they meet up in the dark as they approach the house. C'mon. They approach the house and look for a way in. What if there are cameras? There aren't, just keep your hat on...and chill out. It's fine. They go around the house and find a side door open. Rebecca leads the way in. They enter the dark house, and find her bedroom. 58. They look through her closet. Rebecca stands in the doorway of the bathroom that opens on to a dressing area. She looks through drawers, takes a make-up bag, and looks through the medicine cabinet. She finds a necklace on the counter - a gold chain, with an `R'. She puts it around her neck and clasps it as she looks at herself in the mirror. Nicki and Sam grab designer purses and clothes.   A cat comes up to them. She has so many Chanel bags. I love this one! That's so cute. They load up bags, try on shoes. Rebecca closes the bathroom door. What are you doing in there? When you have to go, you have to go. Are you fucking crazy? How are you so relaxed? We hear the toilet flush, and Rebecca comes out casually with some stuff with her. She looks around the closet. Some headlights flash, as a car pulls up outside. Oh fuck, someone's here. Don't freak out, let's go you guys.  59. They quickly head out a window onto the roof, as we hear someone entering the house. Over the empty room, with stuff all over the floor, we hear someone calling from entrance. WOMAN'S VOICE  Hello? Hello? The kids scramble and run in the dark, until they find a street. We hear coyotes howling. Oh my fucking god. That was so close! Everything's cool, c'mon. They climb up and onto a street. Someone walks by with their dog. The kids try to look casual, just walking down the street. Hi. Hello. They walk, with a few bags. You guys wait here, I'll get the car. She walks off, and the rest of them sit on the curb. Marc and Nicki smoke cigarettes. That was fucked up.  60. I know! She opens a big tote bag, and pulls out a little Chanel Mademoiselle quilted bag. Look a Mademoiselle bag! How cute is this?! That's so cute. Did you get me one? Rebecca pulls up in her car and they get in and drive off. I think the biggest problem was after the Audrina thing-nothing happened-it gave Rebecca that self- boost that, oh, this is okay. I can get away with this. And I think her projecting that onto me made me think that it was going to be okay. Music blasts, as the kids make their way through the crowded, smoky party. Sam and Nicki sport their new Chanel bags. Some guys play beer pong. Some drunk girl comes up to Rebecca. Yo, Becca. Yo. I heard you went to Paris Hilton's. Yeah. And you took some stuff.  61. Rebecca just looks at her like `yeah?'. That's so dope. Paris Hilton... Lates. Rebecca keeps going to a keg. They get some beer in red plastic cups and look around. Chloe, wasted, comes up to them and they scream. Whores! Chloooee. Where've you been tonight? We went to Rachel Bilson's house. No fucking way! Yeah. It was chill... She poses with her new bag. A flash goes off as Marc takes a shot of her with his phone. Sick! Some drunk party girl passing by chimes in. You went to Rachel Bilson's?! Yeah, she's in Paris at fashion week. We just went in... Shut the fuck up. 62. Music kicks in: Stealing-snorting-shopping montage The editing pace gets faster and faster, almost on a loop of stealing, snorting coke in dressing room, while shopping at Kitson, stealing, snorting, shopping, Starbucks...dancing at a Valley party. The kid's photos are mixed in. We see Marc, Rebecca, Sam and Nicki with beach chairs and a vendor's table set up covered in designer "it" bags. There are about 30 Chanel, some Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga bags. Mark wears a sun hat, the girls in big sunglasses take money, they look like kids at a lemonade stand. We see them wasted, taking party pictures of each other decked out in their stolen designer wardrobes. We see over some detectives to computer screens with Rebecca's Facebook page with party shots of Marc, Nicki and Sam posing in their outfits. zoom in slowly to the gold "R" necklace around her neck that we saw her put on at Rachel Bilson's.  63. getting out of a car at a night club surrounded by Paparazzi flashes. Rebecca's like biggest conquest was Lindsay Lohan. She was her ultimate fashion icon. We follow Marc, Rebecca, and Nicki as they go up to the house. Chloe waits behind. I'm staying on look out. Marc follows, but stops before they approach it. I don't think we should do this. If there are cameras, it's gonna be like Audrina's, it's gonna get out. C'mon, Lindsay's gone, I wanna do this, this is our opportunity. Marc looks at her. Let's just go, no one's here, you're on camera, but it doesn't matter, you'll be fine, Audrina's was fine...C'mon Marc- pretty please... OK, but this is it. She smiles, and they head around to the back of the house. They look around and find a side door open. They follow Rebecca in. Marc follows her in.  64. I don't know, I think we should get out of here. You're already here. You might as well come up and get something for yourself. Rebecca and Nicki are freaking out over her clothes. Marc looks nervous, but goes along with them. Marc looks through the medicine cabinet and takes a prescription bottle. He reads label, and opens it, popping one in his mouth. He screws the top back on and puts it in his pocket. Marc paces and keeps a look out. Marc, do you like this dress, would this be good on me? Yeah, sure. Marc paces. Oh my god, this is the dress she wore to the Cosmopolitan opening! Oh my god, that's so cute. She shows them a jacket. What do you think? They load up bags, in fashion heaven. Nicki takes an Ed Hardy skull sculpture. Rebecca finds a little Louis Vuitton rolling suitcase, she rolls behind her.  65. it. At a dressing table, Rebecca sprays herself with Lindsay's perfume - slight slow motion as she sprays her neck while looking at herself in the mirror, lit by the vanity table lights. There's a fetishistic feeling about the way she sprays the perfume and watches herself in the mirror. We see them leave Lindsay Lohan's through the grainy black and white footage of a surveillance video. Marc is dropping Rebecca off. When are you coming back from Vegas? I don't know, I'm just going to stay with my dad until things calm down with my mom...I need a change for awhile, I'll call you from there. Will you hold on to some of my stuff for me? Yeah, sure. She kisses him on the cheek, and gets out of the car, putting on big Lindsay Lohan sunglasses. He watches her walk off, wearing a jacket we saw her take at Lindsay's, and rolling Lindsay Lohan's Louis Vuitton suitcase behind her. Why do you think Rebecca was so obsessed with these women and their clothes - enough to steal?  Revised Blue - 03/16/12                66. I just think she wanted to be part of, like, the lifestyle. Like, the lifestyle that everybody kind of wants. Rebecca disappears down the long airport terminal hallway. We see the security camera footage from Lindsay Lohan's house. Lindsay Lohan gave police the security footage from the night of March 23rd when her house was burglarized. Comparing the clips, it looks like these are the same burglars as in the Audrina Patridge                     * security video, and L.A. P.D. are investigating the connection of the Hollywood hills burglaries. If you have any information please contact the L.A.P.D. We see Rebecca's facebook page, party photos, her and the other girls wearing the stolen fashion. We hear the voice of a girl over the phone: Marc and Rebecca were bragging about it at a party, they said they had been in Rachel Bilson's house and Lindsay Lohan's. They said they went to Paris Hilton's like eight times... 67. On a monitor -new surveillance video is side by side with the footage from earlier video. They zoom in and freeze on images when they match up identifying some of the figures to be alike. We hear a voice over the phone. That's Marc Hall, Rebecca Ahn and Chloe, I don't know her last name, and Nicki Moore. We see Rebecca's page linking her to Marc as a friend, and the other kids' pages, linking them as friends. We see party photos of them in Paris Hilton's nightclub room, Nicki and Sam posing in lingerie, a photo of Sam with a Chanel bag. Chloe's page of her in vulgar sexy poses with Ricky, with captions -"Wanna smoke a bluuuunt". We hear loud banging, as Marc's mother, in her robe goes to the door. One minute... MAN'S VOICE L.A.P.D. Open the door. She fumbles nervously to open door. She opens the door to big cops in dark uniforms with guns pointed at her. Marc's lying in his bed, when his mom comes in terrified.  Revised Blue - 03/16/12              68. We hear dogs barking outside.  You need to get dressed, they want you to come outside. Marc knows this is it. He throws his arms around her and breaks down crying like a little kid. Mom! Whatever it is, we'll figure it out, honey. She holds him, until a cop enters and pulls him aside, we follow them into the living room. Big cops in uniform stand tall, with intimidating dogs by their side. Are you Marc Hall? Yes... They handcuff Marc. The dogs bark, Marc's mom cries. Marc holds his head low as they read him his Miranda rights. You have the right to remain                            * silent.

MR. HALL What's going on here, what's this about?  Revised Blue - 03/16/12          68A. Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step aside. He continues reading Marc his rights.                         * You have the right to speak to an                   * attorney present during any                         * questioning.

Cops bang on door. Open up, L.A.P.D. Laurie is hysterical in her Juicy sweat suit as she opens the door. Her Yorkie barks.  70. A big gold Buddha statue stands near the entrance. Yes? Is this the residence of Nicolette Moore? Yes, what is this about? We have a warrant to search your house. Everyone needs to come outside. The girls yell from upstairs. Oh my god, what's going on! Laurie, who looks terrified, tries to remain calm and centered. Girls-You need to come downstairs, now. Ma'am, we need you to secure your animals. What is it?! Police go into her room to search. I don't understand?! What's happening?! The police bring out a Louis Vuitton suitcase and designer bags and clothing from her room. The girls come into the living room. The Yorkie keeps barking.

They put Nicki in the back of the police car. A neighbor kid takes a photo with his phone. Mom! The girls are all crying and freaking out. What's going on?! Why are they taking her?! Sirens scream as they pull away. Laurie , Emily and Sam in their robes and pajamas come back in to their livingroom. Girls, we need to have a prayer circle right now. We need to center ourselves. Laurie takes their hands and she and Emily, Sam and Henry form a circle holding hands.  72. I know that right here and now there is one mind, one presence, and I trust and know that this whole experience right now is strictly for the higher good of each and every outcome, I give thanks and this is the Truth. And so it is. And so it is. Police knock on the door of the well-kept home with a BMW in the driveway. Rebecca's mom, a put together middle-aged Korean business woman opens the door. REBECCA'S MOM Hello, how can I help you? Is this the home of Rebecca Ahn? REBECCA'S MOM I'm her mother, but she's staying with her father in Nevada. Ma'am, we'll need to get her current address. She nods. In a working class Mexican neighborhood, Rob is led out of his house in handcuffs and put in a police car.  73. His small Mexican mother in her house dress watches emotionally with Rob's 12-yr-old and 8-yr-old little sisters in pajamas, as they take him away. Ricky looks pissed, being led out of his condo in a kimono robe and socks, way too early in the day for him. Police officers follow with a jackpot of illegal substances, zip- locs of large amounts of mushrooms and guns. A pitbull on the lawn barks at the cops. What the fuck, man... Chloe and her parents are at the breakfast table. They sit in an upper middle-class beige dining room, her mother in cream work out clothes and her father in a suit, reading the paper. Chloe texts on her black berry while she eats cereal. Two small white dogs lay at her mother's feet as she drinks a fruit smoothie. Sirens interrupt the scene, as they approach the dogs start barking. Cop cars are parked in front of a beige Calabassas McMansion with a Lexus in the driveway. Chloe, in sweats, is led out in handcuffs. Marc is being questioned by detectives in a small room. He has photos of the other kids in front of him.  74. We knew he was out of town through the internet, you'd google his name and see "Orlando Bloom is shooting a movie, he's with Miranda Kerr in New York." We walked in, it was unlocked, there was no alarm. The door was unlocked? Yeah, I've never even broken a window. How did you find the Rolexes? We found a safe at the bottom of a closet with the Rolexes and like five thousand dollars...I'll give everything back that I still have, and I'll find a way to repay them, I'm really sorry about what I did. Did you know Rebecca was leaving the state? I just thought she was going to stay at her dad's cause she wasn't getting along with her mom and step dad. You didn't know she was crossing state lines with stolen property, and leaving you holding the bag?  I thought she was just visiting her dad. 75. Debbie is driving him home in silence. Marc looks out the window taking it all in, thinking about Rebecca and how it's all over. A song comes on the radio that we heard earlier when they were having fun together, he holds back tears. We see over Marc's shoulder to his computer screen as he goes to Rebecca's Facebook page. What we've seen earlier as a page full of pictures and messages is now blank, with only Rebecca's ID photo and an icon of a lock with the message: Rebecca only shares some information publicly. If you know Rebecca, add her as a friend or send her a message. We see police cars approach a small house in the desert. Police knock on the door, and Rebecca opens it. We have a warrant to search the premises. Are you Rebecca Ahn? Yes. The detective reads Rebecca her Miranda rights. She is calm and collected. Do you understand your rights? Yes.  Revised Blue - 03/16/12           76. Do you know why we're at your home serving a search warrant? Yes. Why do you think we're here? My friend Marc was arrested and he                  * called me from jail and told me the police had done a search warrant at his home. Do you know why? I've been watching TMZ and they've been saying I'm a `person of interest' in these burglaries. Were you involved in any of the burglaries to these celebrities? No, I wasn't. Is there going to be any property from any of those burglaries in this residence? No. Have you been in any of the celebrity's homes that have been burglarized? No. Could any of your fingerprints of homes?  77. No. Some police look through Rebecca's room, her closet. They check a label and hold up some items of clothes they've been looking for. photos from the safe. The police enter the living room with the found items and address the detective. We've located a jacket and jeans that match the description by Lohan, and personal photographs of Paris Hilton. Rebecca's face goes white, and she loses her composure. If I tell you where everything is, would you let me go? Hypothetically let's say I may know where this property is located and who has it, how could that help me? The detectives on this case are trying to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property for the victims and I'm sure they would say if your cooperation helped them locate it. I want to help you out, but I don't want to do anything without talking to my attorney. As the police continue to search, a box is open on the coffee table with pot and a pipe.  78. Is this your marijuana? Yes, I have a prescription for it and bought it in California. The police pack it up with other evidence.

Now she lives with us, my mom's home schooled us all for a while. The philosophy of `The Secret', it's based on the law of attraction, but my great- grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy. It's man's relationship to the Divine, that's what energy science means. Since I was young I learned about every religion. So, Sam was in your ballet class, did she have parents? She had a dysfunctional background, we both did... And I met her mom-- Can I talk please?! The reason we related so well is my dad is a recovering alcoholic and Sam's mom is..  82. A practicing... A practicing drug addict and alcoholic and our moms became best friends and... And then she went off the deep end, she was on the verge-- Please! I told you that if you're going to be here you had to be quiet! That's why I didn't want you here because you talk! So, basically you took her in. Yes, we took her in about 6 years ago. But let's get back to Nicki. So Adam here told me you do charity work. Yes, we do a lot of stuff through our church, it's Agape Church. It's the religious science philosophy being taught at Agape Church. My other sister, Gabby is on a trip with them now helping build homes. And they do a yearly trip to Africa where they build wells and schools for kids. Which country?  83. Uh, I can't remember exactly which country... We do bake sales and feeding the homeless, that kind of stuff. Ok, so it's a little bit of a disconnect with these positive pursuits and what's happening now. Nicki, I don't want you to answer that comment. I think that I'm a firm... I have a good statement to say. She can speak generally. I'm not gonna speak about the case, what I was going to say is that I'm a firm believer in karma and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. Nicki is getting emotional as she speaks, her voice quivers. I don't think the universe chose a better person than me because from this it's not just affecting me, it's affecting the media and everyone and I think I'm meant to bring truth to all this....I believe that I am an old soul. Yes, she is. We have gotten to know Nicki and her family and we feel Nicki is an extremely focused, honest person who has a lot to provide to the community.   84. And we agree that there hasn't been a disconnect, that there were circumstances that happened but Nicki herself continued to stay on her plane despite the tumultuous experiences happening. What's your goal or life plan if you have one? I do, I think my journey is to be a leader and push for peace and for the health of our planet-- Nicki starts to get teary eyed. Nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism. It's my main goal. God didn't give me these talents and what I look like to sit around and just be a model or famous. I want to do something people notice, that's why I'm studying business, so I can be a leader and take a stand for people. Over Kate's shoulder, we see Marc speaking into her tape recorder, with his lawyer at his side. I met Rebecca in school after I moved back and went to Indian Hills, I went there because I had a lot of absences. I didn't want to go to school, I had a lot of self- loathing and anxiety issues, I felt that I was ugly... You're not ugly.  85. I know I'm not ugly, but I never thought I was an A-list looking guy.I Went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers, I felt so self-conscious I didn't look as good as everyone else. And now you're a star. Marc laughs. On my Facebook page recently I had 800 friends requests, I accepted them all, I didn't even look at them, then I noticed someone had created a fan page for me. If it had been for something I had done to help the community or benefit something I'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society... It's kinda showing that America has some sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing. targeted A-list stars. After months of break-ins to the Hollywood homes of celebrities including Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, police say they have finally cracked the case. Could a group of Tinsel Town teens be behind a multi-million dollar heist? Mike Van Freen has the details. We see a montage of the kids, and the victim's homes and celebrities on the red carpet.  86. Could these teenagers be at the center of a celebrity crime spree? Police say they have stolen millions in cash, art and jewelry from the mansions of Orlando Bloom, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and countless other stars. It's a sunny L.A. day. Laurie, Nicki, Sam and Emily get out of their black S.U.V. dressed for court. Can I have a 5 mg adderal. Laurie hands her a pill from her purse, as they stop to do a quick prayer on their way. Just remember what we went over with Shannon, they can't prove you were in any of those houses. I know, mom. Laurie smooths her skirt, as she stands straight in high heels. They take hands and bow their heads. I know right here and right now there is one mind, one power and one presence. Mom, shouldn't we go? Stop! Stop what? Stop talking.  Revised Blue - 03/16/12              87. She's praying. I know I'm always protected and karma cleanses my journey. Thank you Lord, so much for this truth. And so it is. SAM,EMILY & LAURIE And so it is. ... You rock girl!                                    * She hugs her and they break like a football team, and head to court. Nicki, dressed as a sexy school girl walks up with her mother and sisters. Her lawyer, Shannon, is dressed for success. They are flanked by paparazzi and video camera crews. Nicki stops to make a statement. Shannon stands by her side, getting in the shot. This is a very difficult time for myself and my family. Thank you for respecting my privacy, I look forward to my day in court. She does a flirtatious eye roll and saunters past the cameras in her kitten heels. We see Chloe enter the courthouse with sunglasses on, flanked by lawyers surrounded by paparazzi and video crews. She keeps her chin up defiantly and makes her way in. Marc walks in with dark sunglasses, wearing a suit, surrounded by camera men. They shout his name to get a shot.  88. How does it feel to be a rat? Marc keeps walking, lawyers by his side, music takes over the sound and it becomes slow motion. Flashes go off and he makes his way through the mayhem. We see Marc, Chloe, Nicki and Rob sitting in a row, dressed for court. Rebecca, dressed for court, walks with her mother, who's hair is pulled back severely. She's dressed in a dark suit and tinted glasses. They are flanked by lawyers. She speaks coldly to her in Korean, Rebecca answers her in English. REBECCA'S MOM  Sit up straight, and speak up when you answer questions. Ok. REBECCA'S MOM  What were you thinking? While I was working to support you and your sister. I gave you every thing... You've never done anything right. Rebecca enters with her mom and lawyers and is brought to a row of seats with Marc, Nicki, Chloe and Rob. She is seated next to Marc, but doesn't look at him. Marc looks over at her, but she stares ahead. The court room door closes. BAM- we hear the sound of a gavel banging over black.  Revised Blue - 03/16/12                 89. Nicolette Moore, you are found guilty on one count                                     * of first degree residential burglary. The court room door flies open and Rebecca, Marc, Chloe, Nicki and Rob are descended on by the press.                      * Marc Hall, you are found guilty on                      * 4 counts of first degree                                * residential burglary.                                   * Flashes and coverage continues as they leave. Nicki sobs, we freeze frame on her through a paparazzi's long lens for a few frames and then continue. A distressed Laurie follows like a protective Lioness. Marc looks in shock and keeps his head low, and Rebecca looks pissed as they are led out. We see news cameras descending on them. Marc Hall, you are found guilty, with a charge of 6 counts of residential burglary. You are sentenced to 4 years in state prison and restitution of $800,000. News coverage takes over from the voice of the Judge. From the view of a TMZ-style low-res video camera: They leave the courthouse in the mayhem. We see Nicki, Marc and Rebecca trying to get out with press and lawyers surrounding. Nicki cries, Laurie's freaking out. Rebecca Ahn and Marc Hall were both sentenced to 4 years in state prison. Chloe Taynor and Robert Hernandez were each sentenced to a year. We watch them leave as we hear the voice of another reporter.     *  Revised Blue - 03/16/12            89A.

It's a sunny afternoon. We see Marc handcuffed to criminals being led onto a white bus that reads: County of Los Angeles Sheriff's department. Marc sits next to a big, hard-looking criminal. bus pulls away. Light streams in on his pale face. He looks out as the Los Angeles streets go by. Cut back to Marc's young face looking out the window, music starts, and the bus drives out of frame. Nicki, in full hair and make-up sits in front of a draped curtain back drop talking to an E journalist. We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30 days for her involvement in the Bling Ring, and shared a cell block with one of the victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were reports that Lindsay was crying, with you being next to her, did you actually hear any of this? I could hear her crying the first day, which is hard when you're trying to be strong, I just tried to really keep to myself..., I just tried to get through the day , the days are so long you're woken up at 5:30. And how'd she look? She got to keep her extensions in, most girls were talking about oh- I had to take my weave out...she was in orange like all of us...  91. Were you nervous you were next to her because you were accused of being a part of that group that allegedly robbed her house. Yeah, it was hard for me there were tabloids and on T.V.s in there people were watching the story and they were showing the surveillance video and stuff... and little do people know that when that video came out I was actually in contact with her manager to tell her who I believed the people were who robbed her house... and eventually when I'm able to tell my story people will know the truth. So that's nerve wracking she could think you robbed her house. She could've, but you know...yeah...Anyway, you can follow everything about me and my journey at Nickimooreforever dot com.
