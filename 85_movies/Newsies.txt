Thank you, much obliged --  David is incredulous -- then sees Les by the boxers moving up to a spectator, assuming a pathetic look. Buy me last pape, mista...? He coughs, Camille-like. Makes the sale. Down the sidewalk Jack nods approvingly; David is disgusted. Our father taught us not to lie. Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education. You just make things up -- like those headlines. I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter. The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers!  Hold it -- I smell beer! The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some -- that's how I made the quarter! Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'?

I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us -- Jack scoops up Les -- who's loving it -- and carries him across the plank. No?   What're they doin' then? I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit -- The boys run out of a doorway onto the street; Jack stops, looks around carefully, as if expecting Snyder to come bounding out of the sky. David is bursting with suspicion -- starts to say something, but Jack shushes him, leads them quickly, furtively into -- Jack runs to a side door and opens it, waving David and Les inside. He follows, giving a quick look around before he closes the door. we're in a theater, as the boys huddle against a wall, catching their breath.  I want some answers -- Why was he chasing you? What's the Refuge? The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy, Snyder, he's the warden. You were in jail...?   Why? I was starvin'. I stole some food.  Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' --  Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'? You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you? Because I escaped.  Oh, boy. How? This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage.  Bet it was the mayor, right? Nah. Teddy Roosevelt.    Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack             * that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short                * flight of stairs, a vision is frowning down at them,                 * speaking in a theatrical Swedish accent.                             *   What is the meaning of this? No one is allowed backstage -- you will leave at once! Out, out, out, out -- She descends the stairs grandly, shooing them away like pigeons. Jack turns to her and grins. You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent quickly disappears. Kelly, where've you been, kid? I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you. This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark.  Welcome! Medda also owns the joint.  Don't ever own a theater, kid. Don't even think about it.  I won't. I promise.  What have we here -- ? Aren't you the cutest little fella that ever was -- yes, you are --   Buy my last pape, lady? A Camille-cough.     Medda looks at him critically. This kid is good. Speaking as one professional to another, I'd say you got a future. Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away? As long as you like -- now the lark must warble. Hey, you -- candy butcher) -- give my guests whatever they want.  She winks at the dazzled boys and hits the stage, singing:  'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY'... etc. David and Jack can't take their eyes off her; Les can't take his eyes off the candy butcher's tray... Les is looking green from all the candy as he follows Jack and David, balancing on trolley tracks. In the distance, the FAINT sound of SHOUTING/SINGING. It's late, my folks'll be worried ... What about yours? They're out west lookin' for a place for us to live -- from his pocket) -- like this. It's the cover of a dime novel with a blue-perfect sky over a perfect yellow desert; a large red sun shines down on a perfect adobe. That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me.  Then you'll be a real cowboy... Jack nods quietly. David looks at Jack, not believing a word of what he's saying; seeing how much he wants it to be true... The SINGING grows LOUDER, the haunting refrain of "Seize The Day," as the boys continue -- 4/8/91 YELLOW                                        28.         * Down the street, a trolley is in flames, surrounded by a mob of shouting men. David looks at it nervously. Why don't we divvy up at my place...? You can meet my folks... The mob is chasing two men towards them, screaming -- Scabs!   Soak the scabs!   Etc. A conductor with a bloody head and terrified face runs past them -- but conductor two is caught, tackled, beaten -- David pulls Les away -- Jack -- let's get outta here -- ! The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating. Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline. The boys enter, Jack carrying the sleeping Les.   ESTHER, 38, is setting the table.  My God...! What happened? He's just sleeping, Momma -- She quickly takes him from Jack. MAYER, 43, is relieved but angry to see his sons -- his right arm is bandaged. We've been waiting dinner -- where've you been? David says nothing; crosses to the table and dumps the day's receipts on it, looks up at his father proudly. You made all this selling papers...?  4/8/91 YELLOW                                            29.        * Half of it's Jack's -- he's our selling partner. And our friend. This is my parents. Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH, 16, enters from another room with an armload of lace piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly tongue-tied. That's Sarah.    My sister. She smiles -- Jack still can't find his tongue.       Mayer, seeing his awkwardness, steps in -- Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup.  Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Esther herself as she waters the soup. Jack stands drinking in the family's warmth. Les mumbles in his sleep on a board stretched between two chairs. Jack, eating heartily, his eloquence regained, holds forth at the dinner table. What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks --  -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat. That many...? More when the headline's good. What makes a headline good?  4/8/91 YELLOW                                            30.        * Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse' or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love nest' or 'nude' -- Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked.  'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much...  You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! That's for your birthday tomorrow! I've had enough birthdays!    This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised. All activity stops, an awkward silence.       Mayer looks at his bandaged hand. It will heal... they'll give me back my job... I'll make them... Jack sees how worried the family is.       No one seems able to speak, then --  'Gimme all ya got, baby...' The family is shocked -- except for Jack and David, who sputter into laughter. The celebration is restored -- Jack digs into an enormous slab of cake, looking around at the smiling faces, for the moment feeling he belongs... Jack and David talk; the family visible inside. How'd your pop get hurt? The factory. An accident.  He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him. Inside, Esther is singing a lullaby to Les; Mayer calls out to David. David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. Why don't you stay here tonight...? I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         *                                           * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 * See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner.  Carryin' the banner. Jack watches as David rejoins the family inside, the warmth, the casual intimacy. He moves off, singing: SONG:   "SANTE FE":   3:06 MOTHER, DAUGHTER; FATHER, SON   4/8/91 YELLOW                                      32.

WHEN I DREAM I'M ALONE, BUT I AIN'T LONELY NIGHT'S THE ONLY TIME OF DAY SLEEPIN' THAT'S BOUND FOR SANTA FE... Still singing,               LIKE I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER Jack drops off the fire      IT'S A FEELING TIME escape into the alley;       CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY moves to the sidewalk        ALL I NEED'S A FEW MORE DOLLARS and walks off.

CALLED SANTA FE...? Jack approaches the entrance as Racetrack comes down the sidewalk. How'd it go at the track, Race? That hot tip I told you about? Nobody told the horse. They smile and continue into -- Jack and Race pay Kloppman for the night. You missed your supper, boys. Then we didn't miss much, did we?                     *  4/8/91 YELLOW                                             34.         * I ate, Mr. Kloppman, I... say it) ... I was dinin' with a family. Race and Kloppman exchange looks as Jack moves on -- Jack enters the empty room and walks past a row       of wash basins to the last one. He reaches beneath it,        dislodges a brick and removes a small box. In the box is        a tin Prince Albert Tobacco can -- Jack puts today's       take inside it. Then he removes -- -- a photograph: faded, dog-eared. Against a Coney Island western backdrop, fake cactus, fake fence, a smiling man and woman beam down at a small boy in a cowboy hat -- it's Jack, about Les's age, with his parents. Jack sits hunched under the basin, alone, staring at it... Pulitzer in his shirt-sleeves glowers impatiently as a prim 1899-vintage numbers cruncher -- JONATHAN -- deliv- ers the bottom line with charts, graphs, etc. Seitz lounges, yawning. Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn -- Seitz!   What in blazes is he talking about? Says you need to make more money, Chief.  4/8/91 YELLOW                                            35.        * Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?  I have several proposals. The first is to increase the paper's price -- Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant. Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- Wait. What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If  you raised it to sixty cents -- A mere tenth of a cent per paper -- -- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here. Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst.  Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst and I would cut each other's throats to get the best of the other. But as businessmen -- and gentlemen -- we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself. What about the other papers -- ? If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption. Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone. Jack bounces into the square, still   basking in the glow of last night. He looks up to the    chalkboard and sees the headline: "BLOODY BEATINGS IN    TROLLEY STRIKE!" He grins, gives the high-sign -- a   very salable headline. He moves on to -- Something's wrong -- angry shouts, arms waving.       Puzzled, Jack shoves through the angry Newsies to -- They jacked up the price! Ten cents a hunnerd -- I can eat two                                   * days on ten cents!                                                 * This'll bust me -- I'm barely                           * makin' a livin' now --                                  * I'll be back sleepin' on          * the streets --                    *  It don't make no sense! All the money Pulitzer makes, why would he gouge us? Jack sees Weasel behind his window, grinning. Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter.      Weasel's grin gets weaselier as he slides it back. Hunnerd'll cost ya sixty, Cowboy. I ain't payin' no sixty -- Then move outta the way -- You bet -- I move right over to the Journal. It's the same at the Journal -- we checked -- it's the same everywhere! Why the jack-up, Weasel? Why not? It's a nice day. Why don't you ast Mr. Pulitzer? He whacks the bell with his cudgel; the Delanceys stir threateningly. If you ain't buyin' papes, clear out! World employees only on this sida the gates. It stinks here anyway -- let's go! He leads the angry Newsies out of the courtyard into -- The angry boys crowd around Jack. They can't do that to us -- They can do what they want -- it's their stinkin' paper -- Ain't we got no rights -- ? Sure -- we got the right to take it in the t'roat! It's a rigged deck -- why waste time kiddin' ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it -- We got no choice! So let's get our lousy papes while they still got some -- Nobody's goin' anywhere -- they ain't gonna get away with this! What can we do --  Stop crowding him!    Let him think! They back off, become quiet -- every eye on Jack as he thinks. And thinks again. And again. Finally --  Jack...? Ya still thinkin'... ?                        * Jack looks at him, then the others:    his jaw set. One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was.  You mean like a strike...? Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave.  No, I didn't mean -- we can't strike, we're not a union -- We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave -- Jack's moving across the square, everyone following, cheering, a momentum building. David moves with him --  There's not enough of us -- maybe if we got every Newsie in New York -- Yeah, we organize -- we get all the New York Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin' -- It's no joke! You saw what happened to those trolley workers -- Another great idea! Any Newsie don't join with us, we soak 'im -- just like the trolley workers! Nooo! Stop and think, willya?     You can't just rush everybody into this! The gang is cheering every word; Jack stops at the base of the Greeley statue, holds up his hands for quiet. Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them?   The choice has gotta be yours -- are we gonna just take what they give us? Or do we strike? The Newsies are silent, faltering, suddenly uncertain. Then a small figure steps forward and raises his fist: Strike! The boys explode -- a beat begins to build -- Keep talkin', Jack -- tell us what to do -- Jack looks desperately at David:      what do I say now? Uh... uh... Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect our rights -- Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin' boys of New York!  Keep it comin' -- what else. Uh... they can't treat us like we don't exist... SONG:   "THE WORLD WILL KNOW"   APPROXIMATE TIME: 3:30. NO! If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up. NO!  4/8/91 YELLOW                                              41. It's like a union. The Newsboy's Union. Are we really a union...? WE'RE A UNION JUST BY What's to stop someone else from sellin' our papes? We talk to 'em. Some of 'em don't hear so good. Then we soak 'em. No! WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE YEAH! No! We can't beat up kids in the street! It'll destroy what we're trying to do! WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE Jack's not listening now.

Spot Conlon's territory? Suddenly they all look like they've got something else to do. Whatsamatter?    Scared of Brooklyn?  We ain't scared of Brooklyn. But Spot Conlon makes us a little nervous. Well, he don't make me nervous. You and me, Boots, we take Brooklyn. Dave can keep us company. Okay, Dave? David looks up; Jack grins, challenging him.       David comes right back at him. Sure. Right after you take our demands to Pulitzer.  Me? dome) To Pulitzer?  You're the leader. Jack looks at the huge doors of the World Building, steeling himself. He starts for them, then has a thought -- beckons to Les, who runs to join him, thrilled. Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little. Shouting encouragement, the Newsies clear a path as Jack and Les march up to the big doors. Jack pounds on them and there's a hush as everyone waits, watching -- including a handsome, well-dressed man in his thirties, BRYAN DENTON. The huge doors swing open like the mouth of a whale and Jack and Les disappear inside. The Newsies cheer. Denton moves next to David. What's going on? They're going in to present our demands to Pulitzer. What demands?  The Newsies' demands.   We're on strike. Denton looks around, a little amazed.     He takes out a notebook. I'm Denton, New York Sun.   What's your name?  David... David.  As in David and Goliath?  You really think old man Pulitzer's going to listen to your demands? He has to. At that instant, the big doors swing open and Jack and Les are spat out like two seeds.  So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an appointment with me! The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued. Jack, David and Les devour a tray of sandwiches as Denton takes notes. Newsmen at other tables glance over curiously as Jack holds forth.  -- So this snooty mug is sayin', 'You cawn't see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer' -- real hoity-toity, you know the type --  Real hoity-toity --  -- So I says, 'I ain't in the habit of transactin' business with no office boy -- tell him Jack Kelly is here to see him now.' That's when they threw us out. Doesn't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York?  Yeah, lookit me, I'm tremblin'. Denton smiles, closes his notebook.    Gets up, handing David a card. Keep me informed -- I want to know everything that happens. Are we really an important story...? What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you.  My name really gonna be in the papers? Any objections? Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures. Denton smiles and shrugs.    David suspects Jack's thinking of Snyder. Jack, David, Boots are walking as we WIDEN OUT to reveal the magnificent bridge against a dawn sky. They all seem a little nervous. I've never been to Brooklyn -- have you guys? Spent a month there one night. This Spot Conlon... is he really as bad as they say...? Jack and Boots look at each other and laugh; they keep laughing as they walk along -- I say something funny? Come on, tell me -- he bad or not? What's the joke? Tell me, willya?  We KEEP WIDENING as the figures get smaller and Jack and Boots keep laughing and David keeps asking about Spot... 4/8/91 YELLOW                                          48.          * On a rotted and collapsing pier is a battered sign: "BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED." Hunched under the pier is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on -- -- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier. David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly. From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome. He looks them up and down, then grins. He is SPOT CONLON. If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own. You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more nervous. So I'm hearin' things from little birdies in Harlem and Queens and all over. They're chirpin' in my ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are playin' like they're goin' on strike -- '  We're not playing -- we are on strike -- it's -- Spot's eyes click like switchblades in David's direction -- so do his henchmen's. What's this, Jackie boy?   Some kind of walkin' mouth?  4/8/91 YELLOW                                            49.        *  It's a mouth with a brain -- and if you got half-a-one you'll listen. Tell 'im, Davey. David looks at Jack wide-eyed: "Me?" Scared to death, he starts -- as Spot's henchmen begin circling him like jackals. Uh... we started the strike but... we can't do it alone, so... we've been talkin' to Newsies all over the city... So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key... himself up; David sees an opening) That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else... Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling; waits for more, lapping it up. And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack. You're right. Brains.  But I got brains, too -- and more than half-a-one. How do I know you punks won't run the first time some goon comes atcha with a club? How do I know you're in it to win?  4/8/91 YELLOW                                          50.          * 'Cause I'm tellin' you. Not good enough, Jackie-boy.   You gotta show me. He turns and walks away. David and Boots exhale in relief -- but Jack suddenly grabs a rope hanging from the wharf and swings in front of Spot. Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy --  -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours.  Maybe you gotta show me you ain't afraid to join the strike. Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed; the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then Spot grins. Nice try, pal. But that's just what I'm talkin' about.  Show me this strike ain't just some kids do-or-dare, then we'll talk. With a bucket of red paint, Crutchy paints a portrait of Pulitzer on an old bedsheet. Around him, Newsies roll hoops, play marbles, tag, leap-frog, etc. Looks like more of a holiday than a strike. Jack, David, Boots return from Brooklyn. So where's Spot Conlon? Jack looks disgustedly at the activity.  He was concerned about us bein' serious -- you imagine that? Some Newsies gather around, concerned. Without Spot and the others, there ain't enough of us... Maybe we're movin' too soon, maybe we ain't ready -- Definitely should put this off a coupla days, definitely -- Hey, Jack -- you ready?   I'm ready! He's swinging a picket sign. At least somebody's got the right idea. Who else is ready for stick-ball? He tears the sign off the stick and swings it like a bat. Who we kiddin' here. Spot was right. Just a game to these guys... Hey, Jack -- get a loada this! He's waving the bedsheet with the scowling devil-mask of "Joe P" painted on it. Jack smiles as Crutchy parades with the banner, the other Newsies begin to notice. Across the square, Denton lounges with his notebook,               * studying the Newsies as if he, too, were concerned about           * how serious they are.                                              * David watches Crutchy parading with the bedsheet; other            * Newsies put aside their marbles, hoops, etc., and watch.           * Sensing a moment, David moves among them, beginning to             * sing:  4/8/91 YELLOW                                          52. SONG:   "SEIZE THE DAY" As David sings,                 DON'T BE AFRAID AND DON'T DELAY the others join in.             NOTHING CAN BREAK US They stand waiting,             NO ONE CAN MAKE US arms interlocked, as            GIVE OUR RIGHTS AWAY the gates begin to              ARISE AND SEIZE THE DAY         * open... WE'LL SLAY THE GIANT  4/8/91 YELLOW                                      53. DON'T BE AFRAID DON'T BE AFRAID with papers, followed by the nervous non-striking Newsies, are revealed. Weasel and the Delanceys carry            * clubs... * -- Jack signals and Boots, Race and the boys loose a volley of rotten fruit -- With a shrill cry, the Newsies         * rush into the courtyard and leap onto the wagons --              * Denton watches nearby, writing it all down. David moves among the ranks of terrified non-striking Newsies, exhorting them -- Throw down your papers!   Join the strike!  Many of them do -- ripping up their papers, shouting -- -- The Delanceys slog through a storm of rotten fruit; cornering some Newsies by the wagons. They're raising their clubs when -- -- Paint begins to dribble onto their heads -- they look up and the whole bucket is dumped in their faces by Crutchy. They lunge for him, dripping -- he ducks away, poking at them with his crutch -- -- Jack and the others toss bundle after bundle of papers from the wagons -- they're torn to shreds, tossed in the air -- a blizzard of newsprint and then: SHRILL POLICE  Cheezit -- the bulls! The Newsies scatter through the snowstorm of paper as three mounted policemen gallop into the square -- Crutchy, hobbling as fast as he can, falls -- a large hand snatches him up -- Morris, grinning through the paint. But no one notices as -- The Newsies leap, cheering in triumph, through the drift- ing shreds of paper, as they vanish in all directions -- He stands at the window with Seitz. Weasel hovers nearby, awestruck in the presence of Pulitzer. I don't think they're just going to go away, Chief. Just give me the means, Mr. Pulitzer. I'll take care of them for you. Pulitzer turns his godlike gaze on Weasel, who seems to shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment.  Give him whatever 'means' he requires, I want this nuisance over and done with. He looks back down at the square, where Crutchy's crude portrait of him, lying crumpled on the pavement, stares back at him. A dark cheerless building looming over an empty street. The House of Refuge... my home- sweet-home...  He crouch-runs across the street David following nervously. How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?  How can I be sure the Delanceys stink -- 'cause that's how things work. An orphan gets arrested, Snyder gets him sent here to be 'rehabilitated' -- on the roof) -- the more kids in the Refuge, the more money the city sends to take care of 'em, and the more Snyder can steal.  He's here alright. David, looking around nervously, starts climbing after him. Jack and David creep along above some large barred windows. Jack loops the rope around his waist, swings over the edge -- David watches from the roof as Jack taps on a window. An inmate, TENPIN, 9, looks up and grins. Cowboy!   Ya miss the joint? Whattayasay, Tenpin.   You got a new guy, Crutchy -- The gimp?   I'll get him for ya. Jack takes a railroad spike from his belt and begins prying at the bars, talking conversationally up to David who's terrified someone's going to hear them. That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin' more time on his sentence --  Be quiet -- they'll hear you --!  Crutchy appears, grinning at Jack dangling on the rope. Hey, whattaya hangin' around here for? That Dave up there? Hiya, Dave! David pleads for silence.    Jack pries at the bars. Go get your hat, Crutch -- kiss Snyder good-bye.  Yeah... hey, shoulda seen me in court today -- old Judge Movealong Monahan hisself! Took him two minutes to move me along to Snyder for 'my own good.' Later, Crutchy -- get your stuff. Crutchy stops Jack's hand prying at the bars. Listen, Jack... truth is, I ain't walkin' so good. Oscar and Morris kinda worked me over a little... They hurt you...? Don't worry, we'll carry you --  I don't want nobody carryin' me -- never! Jack looks up: Crutchy's eyes flash with pride.       Then he smiles, softens. It ain't so bad here. Get three squares, sorta, and there's some swell fellas...  They still talk about how Jack rode outta here on that coach!   Teddy Roosevelt's. Right? You already heard the story. You mean it's true --? Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into the room. Utter silence -- -- except for Snyder's FOOTSTEPS as he walks slowly down the aisle between the bunks. He stops at the window, his back to it. Crutchy sneaks open his eyes to see -- -- Jack, behind Snyder, swinging past the window, arms stretched in a balletic arabesque -- -- Crutchy struggles not to laugh; Tenpin and some others see what's going on. They all fight laughter as -- -- Jack swings back and forth behind Snyder, striking difference poses as he passes the window: the breast stroke, running on air, a bird with flapping wings... -- From the roof, David looks down in disbelief: then smiles -- nothing Jack does would surprise him any more. -- Snyder glares suspiciously at the boys, sensing something is going on. Behind him, Jack floats past as an angel -- Snyder wheels around, looks -- -- but the window is empty. Puzzled, he walks out of the room. The instant he's gone, the boys explode in stifled laughter. We MOVE IN ON Crutchy as he laughs until the tears come... Jack and David move down the deserted street. Crutchy won't last in there... I seen stronger guys than him not make it.  Did you really escape in Teddy Roosevelt's coach? Not in it.   On it. What was he doing at the Refuge? Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during elections. Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country. Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!' So just as we're goin' out the gate, I stands up and --  'Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!' It was in the papes and everything.  He's governor now. I don't understand how he could see that place and not do anything -- He only seen what Snyder wanted him to -- good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals. I'll bet if he just knew -- I mean, he's a hero -- Last year he was a hero.   This year he's a politician. Weasel moves down a line of frightened young scab newsies clutching their papers. He stops in front of -- -- a burly THUG, 20s, and behind him two dozen more, all clutching newspapers. Okay, 'newsies' -- you check the funny papers this morning? The Thugs unfold their paper -- inside are clubs, chains, brass knuckles, saps. In the distance, we hear MUSIC BEGIN: the marching pulse of the strike anthem...  Before we bust faces, we want our                     * money. Weasel puts money in their hands as they file past.     The        * SONG: SEIZE THE DAY explodes into full energy as Jack and David lead the Newsies across the square towards the gates. DON'T BE AFRAID As the Newsies converge on the gates -- The gates swing open and the young scab newsies file nervously out -- cannon fodder -- as our Newsies line up and wait for them. David leads a chant -- Join us!   Join us! etc. Some of the scabs decide fast -- they throw down their papers and run to the Newsies where they're welcomed with cheers and handshakes -- but then --  Look out -- ! A WAGON is ROARING out of the gates full-speed -- barrel-          * ling towards the line of Newsies --                                * -- the Newsies scatter -- the line breaks as the WAGON -- the army of Thugs, charging through the gates with clubs and chains waving --  -- dozens of scattered battles break out as the Newsies fight back as best they can -- Denton watches at the edge of the square -- nearby him are six POLICEMEN, also watching, doing nothing. Why don't you stop this -- ? coldly) You better move along, mister... Denton turns, picks up something -- a large camera and tripod. He moves off quickly -- -- scattered skirmishes all over the square -- clubs swing, fists flail -- the Thugs move the Newsies back, trying to box them in -- -- Weasel and the Delanceys, backed up by other Thugs, are forcing Jack, David, Race, Mush, Boots and Blink into a tight circle. The boys fight back as best they can, dodging the brutal clubs and saps. As the circle tightens, Weasel's eyes are gleaming with gloat -- Strike's over, boys. Something seems to sting him in the neck -- he slaps at it as if at a mosquito. Then other Thugs begin slapping -- all over the square, Thugs are slapping and looking around in puzzlement -- then -- -- the BELL CLANGS as it's hit by a good-sized stone. Jack looks up as David points excitedly to the roofs where -- -- It's Brooklyn to the rescue: Spot Conlon's gang is pelting the Thugs with volleys from their slingshots -- and Spot himself is swinging through the air on a chain hoist into the square. He grins as Jack runs up -- So, ya showed me! Now I'll show you what Brooklyn can do --! The Thugs retreat from the merciless slingshots -- Jack rallies his Newsies and leads a screaming charge as the Thugs hurry behind the gates, closing them. Jack and Spot spit in their palms, shake hands as --  * victorious -- Jack leaps on a loose horse, pulls David up                      ALL and they lead an impromptu    SEIZE THE DAY victory parade. The police fade away;         SEND OUT THE CALL AND Spectators who have watched it all begin to                    ALL applaud. Many throw           SEIZE THE DAY coins, bills, or show other signs of support...                        BUMLETS Denton flashes a photo as MUSIC ENDS and we see -- The front page of The Sun  SPINS OFF the press -- a big headline: "THE CHILDREN'S   CRUSADE" and a large picture of the Newsies, with Jack  very prominent. We hear A boisterous and happy celebration as dozens of Newsies snatch copies of The Sun from Denton as he passes them out --  -- Waiters bring trays of sasparilla and cold cuts -- everybody talks at once -- * Lookit this -- just lookit this, willya -- ? Where's me pitch'a? Where's me pitch'a?         BOOTS All them words -- are they all about us -- ? Lookit Jack -- he looks like a general or sumpin'!                                      SPOT Where's me name? Where's it say me name? Listen!  Listen up, everybody -- !  'Like a small but rising storm, the infant newsboys' union continues to gather force -- ' Loud cheers. Hey, ya write sweet, Denton -- real sweet. Denton smiles; Jack is in the center, trying to keep cool.  'Their leader is a child of the New York streets with a red bandana and a golden tongue, Jack Kelly -- ' Where's it say that...? Stop t'inkin' about yaself and let 'im read!   'The latest clash demonstrates that the publishers might do well to reconsider their strategy of just waiting out the strike -- '                           * That's their plan? To just wait us out?  You're kids. They think   you'll get tired, or bored, or  maybe just too hungry. And with my   colleagues on the other dailies not  allowed to cover you -- He looks pointedly at a group of reporters leaving the restaurant, shame-facedly averting their eyes. -- They can just ignore you until you go away. We ain't goin' away.   We'll never go away. That's what we gotta show 'em -- we gotta do somethin' they can't ignore, somethin' big -- We'll do it up big, all right -- We'll show 'em we ain't tired, or                      * bored, and the hungrier we get, the more we fight -- writing) We'll have a rally -- every Newsie                     * in New York -- and we're gonna send                    * a message: there's a lot of us and we ain't goin' away -- we'll keep fightin' until doomsday if it means gettin' what's ours! His eloquence is spellbinding; the Newsies are silent, looking at him with new respect. Then, from somewhere, there is a smattering of APPLAUSE. They look to see -- -- At the door,      the group of reporters applauding -- guilty applause      maybe, but still applause. One of them takes a dollar      and puts it in the box marked NEWSIES another... Jack and the Newsies watch -- then Jack begins to applaud the reporters. The Newsies join in, clapping, whistling, as the reporters hurry out, feeling a little better about themselves. platter of them -- as he glances at the New York Sun. Crutchy, with a featherduster, is eyeing the eclairs when he sees the picture in the Sun. That's Jack -- ! Hey, he looks just like hisself! Snyder looks at the picture:    instant recognition. You know this boy...? Him?   Nah.  You have a famous friend, this 'Jack.'... Do you know where he lives...? I never seen the guy, honest. his palm) This brain of mine, always makin' mistakes. Got a mind of its own. He hobbles out quickly.    Snyder looks at him, eyes narrowing. A juggler struggles on stage. Medda, waiting to go on, checks her makeup as Jack and David talk to her. Darlings, I love you -- I wish                            * you luck on your rally, I am behind                       * you one hundred percent. But I'm not running a union hall here -- this is a theater, a temple of art. And well-known money pit. We got money, Medda.      Some, anyway.  David sees him take money out of the Prince Albert can. We'll take a collection at the door. We'll pay whatever you ask. It's not the money. I depend on the papers. They write good things about me, the customers flock here like sheep. They give me the pan, I'm the one who gets sheared. You're afraid of them, too... Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place. How can they make a whole city afraid? We're the ones putting our necks on the line -- all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we're not alone! They have the power to destroy people... They can't destroy you if you fight them -- only if you let them own you!  You are so young... She looks back out at the stage; Jack pulls David away. Then -- Got to be on Monday night.   I'm dark on Monday nights. Jack looks at her, smiles. He tries to put his money in her hand: she refuses it.  Take it, Medda. Please...?                     * reluctantly)                          * Thanks.                                        * Don't thank me. Thank Mr. Wisenheimer Guilt-maker of 1899 there. She winks at David and moves off to the stage.   Stricken   * to the core, David watches her begin to sing.               * Mush painstakingly charcoals "NEWSIES RALLY -- IRVING HALL" on a piece of cardboard. Newsies are scattered in the lobby making handbills, signs, posters. Kloppman comes in and stops short, seeing a dark figure at his counter, going through his register. Can I help you? The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile. Do you have a 'Jack Kelly' registered here? I wish to see him. The boys look up, alert.   Kloppman dislikes Snyder on sight. 'Jack Kelly...?' Any of you boys know a 'Jack Kelly'? Unusual name for these parts.                  SKITTERY I knew a Jack somebody once. Prob'ly not the same guy. You mean Jack Kelly -- ? Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door. Racetrack tries to signal him -- -- He was here but he put an egg in his shoe and beat it. Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying. I have reason to believe he's an escaped prisoner. Possibly dangerous. Oh, dear me... dangerous? My files are in the rear -- this way, please.  He tries to move Snyder away, silently imploring Jack to go -- but Jack takes his time, picks up a leaflet, elabo- rately approves it, pockets it and strolls out, blowing good night kisses. The Newsies crack up -- Snyder wheels around suspiciously. Racetrack thrusts a leaflet in his face.  Give to the Newsies strike fund, mista? Snyder tries to look around the leaflet -- then it catches his eye: "RALLY AGAINST PULITZER." He takes it thoughtfully, making a connection. Smiling dangerously, he digs out a penny and drops it in the surprised Racetrack's hand. The orange glow of a sunrise is reflected in the window. Sarah appears inside, in a modest nightgown. She opens the window and breathes in the morning air. Then she sees Jack hunched against the wall on the fire escape, shivering.  Did you sleep there?    Why didn't you wake us up? Didn't wanna disturb nobody... anyway, it's like the Waldorf out here... great view, cool air -- She glances back in the apartment. Go up on the roof. She pops back inside.    He shrugs, climbs onto -- Jack stretches, shadow-boxes:       something crackles in his pocket -- the rally leaflet.  He's looking at it thoughtfully as Sarah climbs up behind him in a shawl, with a bundle. She sees the leaflet. It's all getting so big. The family's very worried about the boys. And you, too. Your mom and pop are worried about me...?  The whole family... She unfolds the bundle to reveal a breakfast of bread and milk. He digs in hungrily. David says you're moving away when the strike's over. To Santa Fe. I've never been out of the city.  You'd like it out there -- they got this big yellow desert and the air's real blue, see, from the sky, and the sun, it's bigger out there.  It's the same sun as here. No.  No, it ain't...  Not that I been there or nothin'. Guess your parents wrote you about it. Bet you can't wait to see them again.  Sure... big family reunion. Soon's I get the dough for train fare. David said you spent all your money to rent the theater.  Sounds like you and Dave don't do nothin' but talk about me. We do not. Not that I blame you -- me bein' such an interestin' guy and all --  Are you...? They're smiling, their faces close; for an instant, a kiss seems inevitable. But suddenly a gust of wind catches the leaflet and sails it off the rooftop. Jack lunges for it -- knocking over the milk, squashing the bread with his elbow. He looks up at her sheepishly. What'd I tell ya -- interestin', right? Sarah giggles.       The leaflet gyrates in the wind as we Another leaflet reading "RALLY AGAINST PULITZER" Snyder took at Kloppman's) is in Pulitzer's hands as he listens to MAYOR VAN WYCK, very nervous. Nearby is  Of course the city is very concerned that this, uh, event doesn't get out of hand, but... Chief? We can't just charge in and break it up, Mr. Pulitzer -- we got no legal cause. Pulitzer looks as if he knows something they don't.  Would the fact that this rally is organized by an escaped criminal be cause enough, Mayor? An escaped criminal...? A fugitive from one of your prisons, Mayor -- a convicted thief who's been at large for some time under the alias of 'Jack Kelly.' His real name is...? Snyder slinks out of a corner, humble in such august company. Sullivan, Your Honor -- Francis Sullivan. I would have caught him before now but -- You know Warden Snyder, don't you, Mayor? I believe you appointed him. The Mayor nods ruefully; not one of his best appoint- ments. If this boy is a fugitive, then the chief can quietly arrest him and -- Not quietly -- I want an example made. I want this rabble he's roused to see what happens to those who dare to -- well, they should see justice in action. Arrest him at the rally?   But... By the way, Mayor, I'm having a few friends for cards that night -- newspaper friends, Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett. Perhaps you'll join us -- we can talk about the coming election.  4/19/91 CHERRY                                          71.          *  I'd be honored... thank you. Pulitzer dismisses them and they start out, Snyder oozing backwards, the Mayor now all business with Chief Devery. Chief, when you arrest this Kelly, you'd better go in force -- in case some of his misguided friends should start any trouble. As they go, Pulitzer picks up his magnifying glass and examines the leaflet. We CUT AWAY as he stares through the glass so he seems to be looking at -- Boots FILLS the SCREEN as he shouts -- Extry, extry -- Newsies take Noo Yawk! Swarms of excited Newsies engulf Boots as     he pretends to hawk the imaginary headline. They cascade      toward the entrance where Jack and David shake hands,     slap backs as they flow past. Kloppman goes past, then      Denton. Sarah and Les are nearby. Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor!  I'm working press tonight.  The only working press. As usual. As long as you keep writing about us, they're gonna know we exist. Boys swarm into the seats, filling the theater -- down front, the pit band plays a spirited tune. 4/19/91 CHERRY                                      72. as a butler passes cigars in a silver humidor to five men in formal clothes around a table as Pulitzer breaks the seal on a deck of cards. The Mayor is next to him. The room is cavernous, austere. You know the boys, Mayor -- Mr. Bennett of The Tribune, Mr. Taylor of The Times, of course you know Mr. Hearst -- and this is a new member of our little group, Mr. Gammon, who just came back from Europe... GAMMON, a portly fop in muttonchops, shakes the Mayor's hand. Mr. Gammon owns The New York Sun.                     * They all light cigars as Pulitzer begins to deal. The place is packed. The band plays and a thundering            * cheer goes up as Jack, David, and Spot Conlon leap on the stage. Jack raises his hand and the noise subsides, the band stops. Everybody looks at Jack -- expectant silence. He lets it build for a moment, then -- Carryin' the banner!  Carryin' the banner! The noise threatens to blow the roof off the theater as we see -- 4/19/91 CHERRY                                      73.           * A column of mounted police clip-clop down the cobble- stones.

That means we get tougher too -- goes up) -- it also means we get smarter! That's why we're gonna listen to my pal David and stop soakin' the scabs -- No!    They asked for it -- etc. Whatta we s'pose to do -- kiss 'em? I personally wouldn't go that far, Race.  Any scab I see, I soak 'em -- period! That's just what they want you to do -- so they can say we're just thugs -- I don't care what they say -- some of us ain't made to just take it! I say anybody hurts us, we hurts them worst! Who's with me? A large faction roars in agreement; arguments break out as -- Sarah stands next to Denton and Kloppman. Behind them, the door cracks and in slides Snyder. Kloppman sees him and whispers urgently to Denton, who starts moving after him.  Loud voices, fists starting to fly, chaos -- That's right -- start fightin' each other! Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!  Here's how it is: we don't stick together, we're nothin'. We don't trust each other, we're nothin'. We don't act together, we're nothin' -- and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong. What's it gonna be?  Whattaya say, Spot? I say -- He looks out at the crowd; the expectant faces, waiting, afraid it's all going to fall apart. Then back at Jack. I say... what you say... I say! Spits in his palm and they shake. A huge roar goes up and the boys thrust their hands up in triumph -- but the applause isn't for them but for the curtain rising behind them revealing the dazzling vision of Medda, who walks smiling downstage and begins -- *   NOTHIN' TO EAT I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND THEN I PUTS ON MY BEST Hiya, Newsies -- what's new? They roar; Racetrack's on his feet -- Hey, Medda, anytime you're off to the races, remember -- I got all the winners! You're all winners here tonight, Racetrack. Just being with you makes me feel kinda extra extra.  I'm dead, I'm in Heaven -- somebody gimme a harp! But you never know what life will bring. Over the years, I've developed quite an outlook -- Oooo, lookout for that outlook! And all kinds of people are always asking my advice, well, for instance --    'HELP ME,' HE CRIES, 'OR THEY'LL GIVE ME THE AX!' I SAYS, 'YOUR HONOR, YOUSE EVERYBODY! NOTHIN' TO EAT I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND THEN I PUTS ON MY BEST Medda moves through the crowd: You boys sing as sweet as songbirds.

Would you keep it for me? For luck? Boots beams happily as she moves to --  Medda, whattayasay -- you and me, Saratoga. We catch the races, maybe a nightclub --  I'm dreamin', huh? It's some other guy -- right? I'm afraid so, Race... She turns to a little boy and sings --  The boys boo and hiss. SOME, MY DEAR IT'S HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES NOTHIN' TO EAT I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND I PUTS ON MY BEST AGAIN! Medda and dance girls start it but the boys quickly join in -- belting out the lyrics with one great swelling voice, together, celebrating -- The happy song roars inside the theater as the mounted police begin to form a half-circle around the entrance. A paddy wagon clops up and some foot police dismount, among them Officer MacSwain whom we met before. 4/8/91 YELLOW                                        75C. Weasel, the Delanceys, roll up in two wagons, each filled with club bearing goons. 4/19/91 CHERRY                                         76. The SONG fills the hall as Jack, happy and proud, sees Sarah smiling at him, reaches out his hand and pulls her on stage. David is watching this when someone signals him -- Denton, who points his finger at -- Snyder    edging closer to Jack, checking the time on his pocket    watch. He has something in his  hand -- a tin police    whistle. He puts it to his lips  and is about to blow it    when Denton moves up behind him and -- Aren't you Warden Snyder? Snyder nearly swallows the whistle -- I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly. David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it. David shouts over the song -- Jack -- you've gotta get out of here! Snyder! his ear) Snyder! Jack can't hear over the song but Snyder does --  Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door -- 4/19/91 CHERRY                                        77. Jack rushes out and slides to a stop -- -- the mounted police form a half-circle cutting him off -- and from behind them, Weasel, the Delanceys, and the Thugs move through the horses towards him. Jack has no choice -- he turns and races back into -- Jack darts past the cops back down the aisle where -- Snyder is waiting for him at the foot of the stage, crouched like a football player. As he starts to pounce on Jack --  -- David flies off the stage onto his back -- Snyder stumbles around as David hangs on in a wild piggyback ride. A cop pulls him off and hurls him to the floor -- -- Sarah screams, seeing what's happened to David -- Les, sobbing, kicks furiously at the cop's leg. Sarah pulls her little brother away as -- -- Weasel and his thugs burst in the doors, clubs swinging. The Newsies scatter, try to escape -- but at each exit door more cops are moving in -- -- Denton, horrified, shouts at the cops to stop -- a thug cracks him on the head and he staggers, bloodied... -- Spot, Race, Boots dart into the wings and start working the pull ropes -- -- Cops converge on Jack at the foot of the stage, backing away, he leaps on stage desperately looking around when he hears behind him -- Show's over, Cowboy. He turns to see Weasel and   the Delanceys grinning at him, clubs in their hands. They    start toward him and suddenly disappear -- straight down   the trap door that's suddenly opened beneath their feet.    Jack sees Spot at a lever in the wings -- Curtain goin' up, Jack -- ! Race and Boots jerk the ropes of the fire curtain and Jack leaps for it as it starts to rise -- Try to reach the skylight -- ! Cops leap for Jack's legs as he rises above them heading up into the flies. He hangs on, thrusts one fist into the air and shouts -- Carryin' the banner! In the theater, the battered Newsies cheer, heartened. Cops are trying to herd them out -- -- David cheers, pulls for Jack as he watches him rise -- Officer MacSwain has David by the arm -- suddenly --  -- Weasel, climbing out of the trap, hurls his cudgel -- it sails end over end and -- -- Hits Jack in the side -- he plummets into the mass of cops and is engulfed in blue uniforms. David, chased by MacSwain, races across the stage and up the dressing room stairs. MacSwain nabs him, they're struggling; suddenly, at the top of the stairs --  Unhand that boy this instant! up, startled) I said hands off the kid, you red- faced baboon! Get out of my theater -- out, out, out, out, out! David twists away as MacSwain backs stumblingly down the stairs as Medda descends on him in full fury. If you're tired of beating up children, maybe you'd like to try a lady next. Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her -- then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away. Run, David, hurry -- They got Jack -- You can't help him if you're in jail, too! You were right, David -- you've got to keep fighting them -- always.  Now go. Please. David looks at her, very moved, then goes. She turns back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes... A dingy room filled with dusty light.   A BAILIFF announces -- Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan presiding. Weasel is in the gallery as JUDGE MOVEALONG MONAHAN, hungover, winding a pocket watch, takes the bench and glances down at a group of battered Newsies, including Spot, Race, and Boots. Any of you represented by counsel? No? Good. That'll move things along considerably. David sees Denton come in, a neat bandage on his head. Judge Movealong, ya honor, I object. On what grounds?  On the grounds of Brooklyn, ya honor! The Newsies congratulate Spot.    Monahan gavels. I fine you each five dollars or two weeks confinement in -- Five bucks!   We ain't got five cents!  I'll pay the fines. All of them. Pay the clerk. Next. The Newsies mob Denton boisterously.                             * Thanks, I owe ya, you're a right                       * guy, Denton, etc.                                      *   Meet me at the restaurant, all of you. We have to talk. Talk and eat, right? On you, huh, pal? They laugh and clap his shoulders as he looks uncomfort- able. Suddenly David gasps, seeing Jack led out in shackles, his face bruised and swollen. Everybody stares, horrified. Hiya, fellas! Hey, Denton -- guess we made all the papes this time, huh? How'd my picture look? None of the papers covered the rally. Not even The Sun. Jack is stunned, David bewildered, as Denton turns abruptly and leaves the courtroom. The Bailiff shoves Jack in front of the bench. Snyder slips in from a side door. Case of Jack Kelly, inciting to riot, assault, resisting arrest. Judge Monahan, I'll speak for this young man --  You two know each other?   Ain't that nice.  Just move it along, Warden Snyder. This boy's real name is Francis Sullivan; mother deceased; father a convict in the state penitentiary -- David, the Newsies, are stunned as Snyder continues. He is currently an escapee from the House of Refuge, where his original sentence of three months for theft was extended six months for disruptive behavior -- -- Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us -- -- Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape --  -- Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye -- -- Therefore, I ask that he be returned to the House of Refuge -- -- For my own good, right, Movealong? -- and for what Snyder kicks back to ya -- -- And that the court order his incarceration until the age of twenty-one -- DAVID/NEWSIES                       SNYDER                   -- In the hope that we No! You can't do that!              may yet guide him to a No! Etc.                            useful and productive life. So ordered.   Next. The Newsies shout angrily as Jack is led away, struggling. Weasel slips out the door, smiling. David, Spot, Race, Mush, Boots, Blink pick dispiritedly at a plate of knockwurst. Les, hungry as always, finishes a large sausage and takes another as he listens. He won't be there long -- the jail ain't built that Jack can't bust outta. They're buildin' some mighty good jails these days... So where's Denton? He said he'd be here.  We can't let this stop us. We gotta keep the strike going, just like Jack was here.  Yeah, but Jack ain't here. We know that, genius -- if he was here, he'd be tellin' us what to do when he ain't here.  You bummers is givin' me a headache. Where you goin'? We need you. Spot sighs:   he hates having to explain the obvious. Nachally  Spot Conlon is needed wherever  -- which right now is Brooklyn.   Some of my boys is worried,  I must give ear to their concerns  --   palm) -- and reassure them. As he starts out, he passes Denton, coming in. Denton hardly notices him as he moves up to the table and is greeted  by the boys. He seems grim, bitter. Why didn't The Sun print the story? Because it never happened. DAVID/ALL Never happened; whattaya mean?   Etc.  If it's not in the papers, then it never happened. The owners decreed that it not be in the papers, therefore...  I just came to tell you fellows goodbye. They exchange puzzled looks.    David sees Denton's expression. Denton, what's happened -- you get fired or somethin'? Denton forces a breezy tone. Reassigned -- back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you.  They don't always fire you, David. He moves off; David, stunned, hurries after him. They bought you off... didn't they? Didn't they! They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat. This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least. He hands it to David and   goes. David returns to the others, angrily crumpling   the story and hurling it onto the table. The boys look    puzzled; Les, still eating the sausage, picks up the   story and looks at it curiously.                                       * We bust Jack out of the Refuge                          * tonight. From now on, we depend                         * on nobody but the Newsies.                              * David leads Spot, Blink, Boots, Mush, Race as they crouch and creep along the wall. Spot carries a rope. David looks up, searching for a window. Indicates one. That's where we saw Crutchy... He starts to throw up the rope when Boots hisses from the corner, beckoning furiously. They hurry over and peek around the corner to see -- A carriage is waiting. The boys watch as a door opens and two figures emerge. One is Snyder, the other is Jack. They get into the carriage and it starts toward the boys -- who quickly duck out of sight as it CLIP- Where they takin' him...? One way to find out.   Meet me back at the square! David runs after the carriage, leaping onto its back. He flashes the high-sign to the boys as the carriage moves off into the night. David hangs on to the back of the carriage, peering around to see some huge stone gates as it moves into a circular drive and stops. He sees a figure waiting:  4/19/91 CHERRY                                          85. Get him inside. David watches as Jack is led inside by Snyder. A butler leads Seitz, Snyder and Jack across a marbled floor, their FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in the luxurious hall. Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows   him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to follow but   Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside, Jack looks   around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer staring at   him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a moment, the   two just stare at each other. Then --  Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe.                                             * The Driver strolls around the rear of the carriage -- just as David slips beneath it and begins to crawl care- fully toward the front. Finding the lynch-pin that hitches the horses to the carriage, he reaches for it -- just as the horse snorts and pulls the carriage forward a few steps. The Driver hurries back to the reins. With the Driver's boots a few inches from his face, David waits for another chance... Pulitzer paces, watching Jack look at the books, the art, at framed front pages; headlines of the world's great events...  Know what I was doing when I was your age? I was in a war. The Civil War. I heard of it. You win? People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is? Heard of that, too.   I don't just sell ya papes, Joe.   Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly. Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn. You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike -- I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days. Ring for my coach, willya?   It's past my bedtime -- Shut your mouth and listen ! up, startled) You're going to do exactly as I say --  -- or what? You'll send me back to the Refuge? I'll bust out again -- -- and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice -- is that what you choose? I told ya... I can't call off the strike. I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World. And be a scab? Forget it -- For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you. Jack is silent, troubled.    Pulitzer pushes a buzzer. You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning. David is hiding by the gates with the lynch-pin in his hand. Snyder is waiting by the carriage. The front door opens -- Seitz and Jack walk out and appear at the top of the entrance stairs. David calls out -- Jack!  Jack is surprised. He looks at Snyder and Seitz, pulls away from Seitz, slides down a bannister, and leaps to the ground. Snyder lunges for Jack, who manages to evade Snyder's reach.  After him! The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his seat as the carriage separates. The horse runs off. Amidst the confusion, David and Jack tear through the gates way ahead of Snyder.  Don't worry. He's got no place to go. At the pillar, Jack stops running. Why're you stoppin' -- we've got to run! You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail -- It's worth it -- let's go -- You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here -- I don't understand -- I don't either -- I don't understand nothin' no more! Jack pushes David down the street. Just go!  David looks over his shoulder and runs off, leaving Jack alone on the street. Jack steps into the shadows as we... As Jack steps back into the light, the CAMERA WIDENS and we realize he's back in the House of Refuge. Jack begins to sing softly: REPRISE: "SANTA FE." Jack sits in a small dark room -- an isolation room; moonlight shines through barred windows; there's a door with a small serving panel in it. I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HIDIN' YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S GUIDIN' ME TODAY Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy peers through, offering him something furtively: a boiled potato. Snitched it offa Snyder's plate when I was servin' him -- the biggest one! head, looks away) Snyder was eatin' good tonight -- the stuff we don't never get?                            * Patatas... olives...  ... liver and bacon. Sauerkraut...  Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.  So what's it git'cha? Anudder three months, prob'ly. But you can't let 'em beat'cha, right, Jack? We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel.  Jack looks at the            WILL YOU KEEP A CANDLE moonlight shining               BURNIN'? through the bars...          WILL YOU HELP ME FIND MY WAY? YOU'RE MY CHANCE The Newsies chant at the crowd in the courtyard:  Stop The World -- don't scab, stop The World -- don't scab, etc. David moves among them, looking like a leader now. Nobody sells a pape today -- we're hurtin' them and they know it! Remember -- no soakin', no hittin' -- etc. The gates open, the wagons start out, followed by nervous scabs flanked by cops and goons. The chant builds as the scabs parade by, then suddenly -- Look... I'm seein' t'ings... tell me I'm seeing t'ings -- ! David and the others look in disbelief -- walking with the scabs is Jack, wearing a tight new suit, flanked by Weasel and other goons. As Jack moves past, staring straight ahead, the chant dies... What's he doin' with the scabs...? It ain't happenin'... it can't be happenin'... Hey, Jack -- it's me, Mush, lookit me -- look, willya? Where'd he get them clothes -- ?  Mr. Pulitzer picked 'em out hisself. A special gift to a special new employee. Only not so new, huh, cowboy? He sold us out! Ya dirty scab, I'll murder ya -- ! Spot tries to bust through the goons but they hurl him back. David, confused, angry, runs alongside Jack, shouting across the smirking Weasel as they march along --  This is why you wouldn't escape last night -- why'd you do it? Talk to me, you liar! What else did he give you to sell us out -- money? What else? Look at me! walking) You lie about everything -- headlines, your family -- ing straight ahead) -- because nobody counts but you -- nobody or nothing! Look at me. David lunges for him and Weasel grabs him, hissing. I'm gonna be lookin' for you, wiseguy --  -- or maybe you'd like a nice new suit of your own. David twists away, tries to rally the Newsies. Keep after them -- we don't need him!  Stop The World -- don't scab! Etc. Some chant halfheartedly, confused, demoralized. A few toss down their picket signs in disgust. David moves among them, desperately trying to keep the chant going. The scabs move on, passing Les, who gives Jack a stricken look as he moves away.  He's just foolin' 'em... so he can spy on them or something...  That's it. He's spyin' on 'em. He's gotta be. David sits in the window, brooding.  Mayer is removing the bandage from his injured hand, helped by Les. Sarah and Esther work on lace piecework. That hand is not ready to work. Mayer flexes his fingers, pale from being bandaged so long.  Ready or not, it can handle a broom. He gets his coat; Sarah, looking for something, finds a stained paper package under a sewing basket. distastefully) What is this? Hey -- I'm saving that! He grabs the package and unwraps it -- revealing a half- eaten knockwurst -- throwing the wrapping on the floor. Irritably Sarah starts to throw it away when she sees it has writing on it.  Don't be too hard on your friend. Maybe he had his reasons for doing what he did.  I told you. He's spyin' on 'em. There.   You see? Mayer smiles and goes.     Sarah moves to David with the stained papers. It's Denton's story. 'The Dark Truth: Why Our City Really Fears the Newsie Strike, by Bryan Denton. Last night I saw naked force exercised against mere boys, the Newsies, who earn at best a few pennies a day. I wondered why so much, against so little -- ' David refuses to listen; he angrily steps out on the fire escape and stares off into the city. Sarah keeps reading to herself. What she reads disturbs her. 4/19/91 CHERRY                                      94. The gang looks sullenly at the door where Kloppman is ushering in two policemen. He will only be a minute.   Please, no trouble. A policeman stands aside and Jack enters, in the new suit. Utter silence. The police escort him the length of the dorm and into -- Jack goes straight to his hiding place and removes the box. He looks inside and is startled -- -- a dead rat is inside the box, covered with tiny pieces of the photograph with his family. His money is gone. He tosses the box aside; his eyes hardening. The police escort him back into -- A few snickers as he moves toward his bed. Racetrack stands holding a bundle of Jack's belongings: he shoves it into Jack's chest and does his Delancey routine. Dear me, what is dat unpleasant aroma -- ? clench) Go on, take a shot -- I bust your scab face, ya yellow-livered,                           * rotten stinkin' piecea garbage!                         * Jack just looks at him, unclenches his fists. He moves for the door, as one by one the Newsies turn their backs on him. The BIG PRESSES POUND RHYTHMICALLY somewhere O.S. in the building. A candle illuminates Weasel's gloating face as he leads Jack down a flight of RICKETY STAIRS.  4/19/91 CHERRY                                        95.          *  Mr. Pulitzer says nothin' but the best for you, cowboy. He takes care of his loyal employees -- and he's put me personally in charge of seein' that you stay a loyal employee. He opens a door and they enter -- Weasel lights a lantern and Jack sees a wooden bed, an old printing press, junk, all covered with dust. You try any tricks, and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer.  Will you be requirin' anything else? Then I bid you good night. He goes. The great PRESSES THUNDER heavily somewhere in the building above, like a judgment. Jack looks at the bleak room, buried in dust and noise. With the other scabs, Jack steps up for his papers. Weasel shows his usual charm. Sleep well, cowboy...? Jack ignores him, moves off with his papers. The Delanceys pass by; Morris grinning at him, bouncing a club in his hand. Come wit' us, cowboy -- we're gonna fix your pal Davey today -- fix 'im so's he can't walk no more. Shuddup! He backhands Morris in the chops and they move on.    Jack starts after them, alarmed -- then he sees Weasel.  4/19/91 CHERRY                                         96.         * Lift one finger... and you're right back in the Refuge. Jack stops, torn.    He nods meekly, moves off.   Weasel looks satisfied. Sarah, with a basket of lacework, is coming down the street, Les dawdling behind, in a bad mood. Les, come on -- you're supposed to be helping me today.  I'd rather be soakin' scabs. He stops to kibbitz a game of marbles in an alley. Sarah walks on -- suddenly a man steps in front of her.  'Scuse me, sweetface. She tries to step around him but Morris is there. He "accidentally" knocks her lacework into the gutter. Les sees it -- and races towards the Delanceys -- Get away from my sister! He flails at Morris -- who effortlessly shoves him flat on his bottom and turns, grinning, to Sarah. Where's ya brudder, tootsie? Where's little Davey...?  You... stupid... ape! On "ape," she socks him square in the grin -- he recoils, licking a bloody lip. Behind him, she sees David rounding the corner --  David!   Run -- get away! Oscar grabs Sarah from behind and lifts her up, taunting. Yeah, run, Davey! We got the best parta ya family right here! David, furious, runs down the sidewalk towards them. Morris slips on some brass knuckles in anticipation. Sarah struggles, screaming -- David, no -- don't -- ! Oscar hangs on to Sarah, enjoying himself -- suddenly, from behind, two hands grab the rim of his derby and jerk it down to the bridge of his nose. Blinded, he releases Sarah and staggers around, trying to pry the hat off his eyes. Les looks up to see -- Jack! Jack flashes him a grin        as he works on Morris's bread basket. Just as Oscar         frees himself from the derby, David leaps on him like        a fury. Punches fly and the Delanceys beat a quick        retreat down the sidewalk, yelling back -- Ya better run, cowboy -- we're tellin' Weasel! You'll be back in the Refuge by supper time!                                 OSCAR Yeah, run, ya lousy coward -- run! But they're the ones running. David, catching his breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand. Couldn't stay away, huh.                                    * Guess I can't be somethin' I ain't. A scab...?                                                  * Nah.    Smart.                                              * Jack shrugs, smiles.      David looks at him worriedly. Jack, David, Sarah thoughtfully on the escape. Without you, the strike's falling apart... I got no choice. I stay here, they lock me up 'til I'm twenty- one. Les clambers out with a pair of Mayer's cast-off high- button shoes. Jack, for the trip -- a pair of cowboy boots! Sorta. Mayer with a bundle of clothes; Esther with food come to the window. She gives it to Jack. Who knows what's to eat where you're going?  A few things of mine and David's. Wish we had money to give you...  Who needs it...? I go down to the train yards, hop me a freight, go in the best style -- free... I don't know what's waiting for you in Santa Fe, but you'll always have family here. They embrace him and move away. An awkward moment -- Jack picks up the bundle to go and --  You're not going to run away. They'll just come after you. You have to fight them.  They got it all wrapped up, Sarah and nothin' I can do is gonna make one bit of difference. You're wrong. You touched people you don't even know about. She removes the stained pages from her shawl. Denton's story. Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it. Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike -- because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader --' That's you!   He's writin' about you! 'In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope...' Jack listens questioningly. Keep reading. Can these words really be about him...?     As we GO TO -- Denton reads his own words: ' -- And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost...  Damn good writing, isn't it?  Jack has listened somberly, moved. All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...?  They think if the Newsies can do it, why can't they? All they need is a leader. The minute I show my face, I'm back in the Refuge. You'd have help this time. I've been investigating the Refuge -- I know somebody who's going to be very interested in Snyder's little racket.  What happened to the ace war correspondent? This war'll do for now. Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought. Jack...?   You thinkin'...? Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids...  ... Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Newsies -- -- Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out -- let's go get the Newsies --  They still think I'm a scab... I'll tell 'em you was a spy!  How're you gonna reach all these people? No paper in New York will print anything about the strike. We're Newsies, ain't we?   So we make our own paper. Be quiet and let me think. Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else? Advertisements!  Cartoons?  A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again. Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building. Les races off on his mission; the others look question- ingly at Jack. So happens I know a guy with a printing press. The huge PRESSES pound out papers; a LOUD THUDDING rhythm shakes the building -- The THUDDING rhythm seems very near. Jack leads Sarah, David, Denton, Les down the rickety stairs with a candle. They're  right above us -- and if Weasel  catches us, it won't be just me  they'll throw in the slammer  -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES. What -- ? I said shhhh! -- or we all go to jail! The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they go into -- Denton heads straight for the old press, checking it over expertly. Jack directs the others to ink, paper, etc., as -- WHAT'S THAT? SHHH!    YOU'RE MAKIN' ME NERVOUS! SORRY. THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE. WHERE? DAVID/SARAH  4/8/91 YELLOW                                          103. I'M BEGGIN' YA! But --                                                 * DON'T YOU BUMMERS GET WHAT I'M SAYIN' WE'RE PLAYIN' 'EM WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO Denton finds the type- font: David is ready to ink the rollers. A NOISE O.S. makes them freeze. Jack puts his finger to                      DENTON his lips; hoists Les up to     WHO'S THAT? the window to be a lookout. David tosses some candles to Sarah; she lights them                    DAVID for Denton as he works.        NICE CATCH. THANKS. Jack finds a roll of newsprint.

During the above, Sarah holds a candle for Denton as he sets a headline in very large type: HOW WE CAN SHOW and resets the headline: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY. Meanwhile, Jack hits the switch and the PRESS HUMS to life. JACK/DENTON THEY'RE HITCHIN' ON A TROLLEY RIDIN' ON A WAGON STOWIN' ON THE FERRY JACK/DENTON                         DAVID/SARAH HAILIN' FROM CANARSIE            SOFTER  DENTON/SARAH                    JACK/DAVID LET'S JUST CLEAR OUT NOW      GOTTA WRITE THE HEADLINE THAT'S RIGHT                  FOR HELPIN' WITH THE FLYERS SHHHHHHH! should give the impression that they've worked through the night:) A)   Lead type being rapidly hand-set by Denton, helped by David -- a sub-headline forms: "House of Refuge, House of Shame." B)   Papers -- "THE NEWSIE NEWS" -- start rolling off the press as they examine it proudly. C)   They fold and bundle the papers, happy but exhausted. D)   Pale pre-dawn light shines through the window framing Les as they pass him bundles of papers and he passes them out the window to -- papers from Les and toss them into Kloppman's wagon -- he's on the driver's seat, keeping a lookout. Sarah                * climbs out the window, followed by the others. The last            * out is Jack -- carrying his belongings in a rolled bundle          * -- when he and the Newsies see each other, they freeze             * awkwardly. Silence until --                                        *  You thinkin' you'd like to take a shot at my schnozz -- right?  Five to one says you can't break it. Jack laughs -- the tension breaks.    Hugs and backslaps as they climb onto the wagon. The cops are looking for Jack -- we gotta protect him -- Any bull comes after jack, they gotta go through all of us. What's with the bundle, Jack -- ya leavin'? Sante Fe bound, Boots -- but not without givin' Pulitzer one last kiss goodbye -- Boys -- ! He points frantically at Weasel crossing the square towards them. They duck quickly -- and he weaves past whistling tunelessly, drunk. As Kloppman eases the wagon away, everybody looks back, shouts -- Hey, Weasel... Good ni-ight! He looks around blearily:    must be the d.t.'s. WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! swirl and cascade, FILLING the SCREEN as we see working children of the 1890s... young boys in too- large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails... holding picks and shovels far too large for them... girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing... shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the SCREEN: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY! We see that same headline across -- as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a butler  in a khaki uniform. He's reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME" with a subhead beneath it: "SCANDAL HIDDEN FROM TEDDY Man slams his fist on the table in anger. A figure steps I thought you'd feel that way, Governor Roosevelt. Dis-graceful, Denty! Those poor boys -- and I did nothing!  Until now! The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded walking stick. Teddy snatches them as if they were armor. Our Newsies look anxiously around the square, empty except for them. They take pains to conceal Jack among them. So when's the others comin', Cowboy? Jack looks glumly at the empty square; at the gates of the World where Weasel and his goons are beginning to line up, clubs in hand.  They ain't comin'... There ain't gonna be nobody but us... The boys are silent, disappointed, feeling alone and defeated.  Then Les steps forward, a defiant look on his face, glaring at the goons beyond the gates. He sings out loud and clear -- REPRISE:   "AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW" A group of   Factory Boys                    RACETRACK appears in   the square;        NO! followed by   others. The       WHAT IF THE DELANCEYS COME boys begin   to take heart --   OUT SWINGING, WILL WE HEAR IT? NO! More kids are appearing;        SINGING, WHO CAN HEAR A LOUSY messengers, garment girls,      WHISTLE BLOW? kids of all kinds -- Kids are coming from everywhere, filling the   square -- Spot and the Brooklyn Newsies; more and more   kids, cheering, waving the Newsie News -- Jack and   David laugh in triumph as shouting and MUSIC RISES UP TO   -- The SONG RESONATES in the golden dome; Pulitzer stares down at the crowd as the mayor, sweating as usual, waves the Newsies' paper at him. Seitz sits reading a copy, impressed, as Jonathan fields phone calls.  They're all yelling at me -- me! -- factory owners, bankers, businessmen -- the whole city's at a standstill and they're blaming it on me -- !  Kelly's down there. He should be back in jail. News) Those kids got out a pretty good paper, Chief. Too good! Those illiterate guttersnipes couldn't have done this on their own. Somebody's behind this, trying to pull a fast one... Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants to know if you've read the Newsies' paper? Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone. I'm not taking the heat for this -- you've got to talk to them -- settle it -- Tell Hearst I'm busy!  I'll settle it all right -- once and for all. The huge doors of the World Building open and Seitz marches out, flanked by guards. The crowd opens a path as he marches up to Jack and David. It's time to talk.  Like I said, I don't transact business with no office boys.    We talk to old Joe hisself or we don't talk. Period. The Newsies love it. Seitz stiffles a smile at Jack's bravado -- a smile of admiration. Then I guess you talk. Jack beckons David to follow as they enter the huge doors and -- open as Seitz ushers them inside, closes the doors, leaving them alone. Pulitzer waits by the windows, a looming shadowy figure; sounds of CHANTING, SHOUTING floating up from below. David is awed by the palatial office, but Jack saunters coolly to the windows past -- You're going to listen to me, boy -- I'd like to, Joe -- crowd noise pours in) -- but I can't hear ya. We had a deal -- you broke it. You're going back to jail. Maybe. But you can't put every kid in that square in jail. They ain't goin' away, Joe. Neither am I. I can wait them out. It won't be me that's hurt. You sure about that? He nods at David who produces a paper, reads:  'Since the strike, the World's circulation has dropped 70 per cent; advertising has been cut in half -- '  Every day you lose thousands of dollars -- just so you can beat us out of a lousy tenth of a cent per paper. Why? It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe? I'm about to show you what power really is... He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS -- I have the police outside waiting to arrest you -- You lousy double-crossing -- ! -- then I'll deal with that rabble in the street. He's crossing to a buzzer on his desk; Jack, thinking fast, snatches up a copy of the Newsies News. Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers -- That stops him.    He looks at Jack, frowning. All the papers have an agreement... we print nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use? smiles) It was Hearst, wasn't it...!   Hearst? Nah, it was yo -- David quickly stops him, seeing the gleam in Pulitzer's eyes. I knew it. Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us. Well, you're going to expose this backstabber to the other owners -- in exchange, I'll call off the police. Jack and David exchange glances, seeing an opening -- Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed.  All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you! He thunders over them, eyes blazing in triumph. The boys say nothing, just smile up at him knowingly until at last the horrible truth begins to dawn and -- We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' stunned) And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends. Pulitzer walks with stiff dignity to the window; from below, the FAINT CHANTING floats seems deafening to his ears. Perhaps we can resolve our... small differences. David digs out their demands and prepares to read. Race, Boots, Les, etc. unpacking rotten fruit, getting ready for action. They see several police moving into the square -- including a paddy wagon. We gotta warn Jack -- ! The others nod agreement -- but where is he?   Then they see -- Behind Weasel and the line of goons Jack and David are approaching, beaming in triumph. Seitz is with them. Les quickly slips through the bars, running to tell Jack -- but Weasel grabs him, shoves him back roughly -- Jack -- !   Jack -- ! Weasel, surprised, sees Jack behind him. I don't know how he got in here, Mr. Seitz -- but I'll take care of him, with pleasure. Just say the word! With pleasure. You're fired. Come again...? A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping tomato juice off his hands. He said, you're fired. Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders: The strike's over -- we beat 'em!  A huge roar goes up outside the gates -- they swing open and the Newsies swarm in, engulfing Weasel and the Delanceys -- trying to look like part of the gang -- as they rush to mob Jack and David. Jack spots Sarah -- she's waving and pointing in alarm at something.  The bulls! Jack -- the bulls! Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees -- -- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back. Jack spins away and right into the arms of -- MacSWAIN Easy, lad! You don't have to run anymore -- not from the likes of him anyway! Jack looks again and sees Snyder's hands are handcuffed behind him; two cops have him in custody. Denton is there, smiling. We brought the Warden over to say goodbye. Goodbye, Warden. Jack watches, amazed, uncomprehending,    as the cops move Snyder to the paddy wagon. As the rear     doors are opened, several boys pile out -- former inmates    of the Refuge, including Tenpin. As Snyder is loaded     in, the last boy is coming out, crutch first --  Remember what I told ya -- first t'ing ya do in jail, you make friends with the rats, share what you got in common --  Hiya, Jack! My leg tells me the strike's over! *  Crutchy -- I don't get it.   What happened -- ?  Ya orta seen it, Jack -- he came chargin' into the Refuge wavin' his walkin' stick like a sword and he's leadin' this army of lawyers and cops and Snyder's hidin' in the patata bin -- What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in? Who?   Your pal! Him! He points O.S. -- Jack turns to see -- parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking stick in salute to Jack across the square. Jack is awestruck; so are the other Newsies gathering around. Denton moves up to Jack. Governor Roosevelt's very grateful that this problem was brought to his attention. He'd like to offer you a lift, anywhere you like. This time, you ride inside. Jack looks at the coach, torn. Boots holds the bundle of belongings he gave him earlier. Suddenly Jack decides, snaps his fingers, Boots tosses him the bundle. Think he could drop me at the train yards? Denton moves off toward the coach. David, Sarah, Les look stunned, dismayed -- Jack avoids their eyes. Behind them, the BELL RINGS, the circulation window opens for business -- a crowd of Newsies races to line up. The gang looks at them hungrily, eager to return the work. They look at Jack.  You really goin' this time...? It's now or never, Racetrack. Won't be the same without ya. Give ya even odds on that. He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him. See ya in the funny papes, cowboy -- Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled.  Ya hear what he said -- Blink says... ya hear it? We heard it. marbles) My best shooters. Never know when ya need good shooters. Take it   easy, Jackie- boy. Ya    ever get in a spot -- palm;   shakes) -- think   of me. Don't wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I hear, out West ain't like New York at all -- it's fulla bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and --  I'll miss ya, Crutch. Crutchy hobbles off to the dock. Jack looks off at the waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs up and clings to him.  I ain't no good at writin' and stuff but... I'll be thinkin' of ya... You don't have to run away anymore, Jack. You have a choice now. We won today, but the fight's not over. You're needed, Jack. We need you. Here. He stands, looking at them. Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him, holds him, as he and Sarah watch -- -- Jack climbing into the coach, greeted by Teddy.          The door closes, the coach trots away. "SANTA FE" is underscored. As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their caps goodbye. David and Sarah watch, feeling a great loss; Les is crushed. The Newsies move into the court- yard, trying to keep their spirits up as: 3:00 The Newsies sing as they                        MUSH line up, trying to keep            TRY BOTTLE ALLEY OR THE their spirits up.                    HARBOR sing as they wait for papers, but something's missing...                 NEWSIES a voice, a presence, a        IT'S A FINE LIFE, spirit -- and then --         CARRYIN' THE BANNER...  -- Jack leaps onto the dock and rings the bell --  Call it, Les! Comin' down the chute! The papers slide down the chute; Jack moves to the front of the line grinning -- seeing Sarah smiling at him from the gates. Jack sings   out, the song soars,    continuing as the Newsies are back on   the job -- getting    their papers, fanning out across the   courtyard, into the    city beyond. It is indeed a fine life   as closing credits    roll until we --
