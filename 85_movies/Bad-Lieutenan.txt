"BAD LIEUTENANT" by Abel Ferrara and Zoe Lund 11/25/90 This story takes place during a World Series between the Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry is still with New York. EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES. The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside LT'S HOUSE. LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY. his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung- over. puts them on. LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy. The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS. Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them up. LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP and the LAWN. As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical. They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS pile into LT'S CAR. INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS, interior. An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats. An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD. As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit detritus. To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before. As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough- house. The CAR swerves crazily. How many times are you gonna miss the bus? Huh? All the other kids can get up in the morning, but you guys wanna be driven around like the fucking President. I'm your goddamn chauffeur! overlapping lines) Shit, man. It wasn't our fault! -- You think Sis is so perfect, well, if she hadn't hogged the fucking bathroom, maybe we -- I thought Aunt Lu was dead! She was in there so long... Shut up! Listen! was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will sweep the World Series. All listen. They're gonna win the Series in four! All the way with Strawberry!  Strawberry! The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- favorite player. They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade. Shit, man -- there's your fucking bus I oughtta make you late! Make the nuns whack the shit outa ya both. box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside. the KIDS inside. Get going. The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the SCHOOL. The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding. EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE and GAWKERS. The BET COP comes up to LT. Two Black kids came up out of nowhere and shot those chicks. Then they laughed as they walked away. The Press is gonna call it the "Giggling Man Murders." I'll tell ya. What a world. The BET COP digs his attitude. But hey -- we make the best of it, man, don't we? Huh? How about them Mets! everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays parked for the duration of their meeting. INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR  - QUEENS Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is exchanged. Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to bet against the Mets. No fucking way they're gonna do it in four games straight. You serious, man? I wanna go Mets all the way! Go ahead, man.If you've got shit for brains. But if you wanna win the bucks, go with Oakland. I thought Strawberry was gonna -- I know that nigger like he's my brother. He ain't gonna let us off so easy. He'll make us sweat first. This game's going to Oakland. Not a doubt in my mind, man. Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment. to LT, his fawning posture is obvious. I'm in. Here. follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND. The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care of a lot of action and has these guy's faith. and the OTHER COPS remain inside. EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- and a hustler just like himself.  I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.  All right. What are you gonna do? I want 15 on the Mets.  How about 7 1/2? raincoat and flash a KNIFE. The BUSINESSMAN gives up his Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. By this time, the BUSINESSMAN is running into the street, waving his arms and screaming. Police! Police! Help me! Police! EXT: EVENING - CRACK CITY young COKE DEALER, JC, cornering him a couple flights up a staircase. Now they're alone and the phony pantomime is over. Hey, man, gimme something cooked! Then LT gives JC a large BAG of COKE, labelled "Exhibit A". It's good shit. From when they busted those Columbians uptown. You can cut it in half. mellow and in control. LT smokes; JC doesn't. I got this guy. But there's someone across the street on the roof! The COPS  rush out of the building. That stuff'll kill you quick, man. What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road. pockets it. See you in a coupla days. Have the cash ready. INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy apartment. However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 that ARIANE quotes as her rent. BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's around a lot. Got something good for us? sloppily partakes. Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching. I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money! nowhere. And fast. We've been rehearsing a new monologue. From Shad's Saint Joan, you know? Bowtay does it wonderfully well. All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff. center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It happens to be appropriate for the scene. the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy saints?", etc. from time to time. He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor. Kinky trio sex scene. INT: LATER THAT NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN It's evidently an hour or so later. The KITCHEN is very bachelorette. No FOOD or COOKING opens the REFRIGERATOR. few suspect and peculiar items. There is nothing in liquid form.  There's nothing! It's clear from the SEX SOUNDS , that ARIANE and BOWTAY are still going at it.  Go out and get some Diet Cokes. INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM as he heads for the DOOR to OUTSIDE. The GIRLS don't miss a sexual beat. They continue what is now a menage a deux. They won't miss LT while he's gone. EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI COKES. A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the sidewalk. picks up his pace. Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.  What's going on? The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie. Uh, Lieutenant, Sir -- The owner says they stole cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught up with them. The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same time -- The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy. We didn't do nothing, man ! loud. Shut the fuck up!  Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And make sure it's fucking cold. situation at hand) I'll straighten this out. The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes. KIDS. How much did they take? Five hundred dollars cash. The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence. We didn't -- the TWO KIDS' heads.It almost takes off the left ear of one and the right ear of the other. The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless. The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.  Take this guy down to the Precinct. I need to talk to him. The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR. They drive off. Now LT is alone with the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS. INT: The store appears to be deserted. Gimme the money! Now! The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool. They are still belligerent. We told you, man. We didn't take no -- same time, he whips out his BADGE and thrusts it into the other KID'S FACE. Give me the fucking money, assholes! They give LT the CASH. The KIDS stand there. What the fuck are ya standing there for? Be gone! The KIDS, stunned, split. assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends to SHOOT at various products. Plays around. In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET PAPER. While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD Take over until your boss gets back.

They steal PURPLE From the FIRST NUN, on her back on the altar, her robes ripped open, a heart-rending pieta, we -- INT: LATE AFTERNOON - LT'S HOME - QUEENS on the floor, two feet from the TV, watching CARTOONS. Various other members of LT's over-extended FAMILY can be seen moving around the house, going about their business. A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT. He jumps up in a panic. Did I win? Shit! The game! TV, turns on GAME FOUR. The LITTLE GIRL starts CRYING. members) What's the score? What's the fucking score? An ANCIENT AUNT pokes her head into the LIVING ROOM. I dunno... She disappears again.  Why me, man? with runners on base. LT CHEERS. They burst into the LIVING ROOM, loud as Hell. Furious about something they out-curse each other.  Shut the fuck up! Did you see that?  It's 7-0: Oakland.  That nigger could have let it drop and gone home. All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind. INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a call for an uptown MURDER SCENE. EXT: NIGHT - 153RD/MARTIN LUTHER KING - CRIME SCENE milk it for what it's worth. some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines.

I'll put it in my trunk. front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he can't show it. LT susses out the situation. Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no apparent avail. and begin his own investigation. distracted. under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the MURDER CAR. Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he -- shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS. The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were far away, somehow know what has happened. They quickly gather round the MURDER CAR, LT, and the KI. The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP PUDDLE.  I guess he was a bigtime dealer...  What d'ya know... A kilo of 'caine... Among the gathered COPS, only a SERGEANT is not quite convinced. Where the fuck did that come from? The other COPS ignore the query. and mumbling.  I can't fucking believe it... his own debacle. LT overhears something. Cuts off his muttering. A group of COPS are talking about the big news from the early morning. But I still can't fucking believe they'd rape a nun, man... has seized LT's imagination. He heads toward the cluster of COPS, cuts in.  What's this shit about a nun getting raped? Where the fuck have you been? It happened this morning, up at St. Dominiek's in Spanish Harlem. A coupla punks tore up the place and then gave it to the nuns but good. The COPS turn away, continue to talk among themselves. LT walks away. EXT: NIGHT - A CITY HOSPITAL PARKING LOT their CARS. itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison. them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are all DRINKING heavily. Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS from previous scenes. What's going on? They raped a nun and tore up the church -- they even took a crap on the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem. She was only seventeen... A COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS, including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP. Who the fuck could do this?! The young nun's just a kid from Ireland. Imagine having to come here to have that happen! Jesus... What's she gonna tell her mother? I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers. The COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or beside the CARS. motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself." The Church already put up a $50,000 reward! Well, one of us is gonna get it. I mean -- get them. The FIRST COP raises a TOAST. Here's to payback for the nuns! The COPS all whoop and cheer. Anyone got any leads, at all? We got shit to go on. Only that list of inventory -- what they stole from the church. Y'know they actually stole those wacky purple robes? And they took the chalice -- with the Host still inside! What did they want with the Host? They were hungry. I dunno. They didn't want to hock the Host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice. shares information, each after the reward for himself. Leave it to the Catholic Church, man. Girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50 G just because these chicks wore penguin suits! Some of the COPS laugh, others are offended.  What's your fucking problem?! The Church is a racket. So what. Are you a Catholic? Sure! Do you believe in God? The BET COP and a couple of OTHER, FAMILIAR GAMBLER COPS move in. They've got nothing on their minds but the World Series.  To Hell with this God stuff. How's that Strawberry? He does what ever you want him to, huh Lieutenant? Even strike out!  I bet you won a shitload on Oakland. How much, huh? his supposed big bet on OAKLAND. to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT just scored big, himself. More than you did. Well, let's see some green! If you know what's good for you, you'll keep staying on Oakland! Oakland? Is that how you're going? Yeah. Sure. Don't you get it? The series has gotta last seven games. The last two did, didn't they? It's a racket. Do you have any idea how much money they make selling television-time for commercials during the series? Especially if it's a New York team? They won't close the gold mine after only four games. It'll last a full seven. Too many people wanna milk it for what it's worth. You'll see! All right... I'm in. After all, you're the expert. Ain't that right, LT? out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND. One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays him off. You'll be sorry, man. But if you wanna be a sissy, here's your bread. STRAWBERRY. The others are uneasy. Why toast STRAWBERRY? Strawberry? I thought we were going with Oakland. We are, man! That's the point! If the Mets win, it's thanks to Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it's thanks to Strawberry. Nothing can happen out there on the field that don't gotta do with Strawberry. So here's to Strawberry! The others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy. INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges; shows his BADGE to the GUARDS. He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even A sexy NURSE stops him. Can I help you? I'm in charge of the investigation. Just checking security.  Security? Do you want those guys coming back? For the nun? Or for you? The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the CORRIDOR. He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE" SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside. He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk, but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack. He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without being seen. INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on a table, her legs spread wide apart. The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene. And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak. Looks like a Pieta. A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed pad. As if it's a parking ticket. The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.  They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane. Then they pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration. They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade, to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound. They -- Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes. INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT both been DRINKING and COKING. subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe. ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other. Have you ever seen a naked nun? I tell you, man, I went to school with the nuns, I've seen hundreds since then and I've never even seen a nun's belly button, you understand? But this nun, let me tell you. What a beautiful lady...  And where'd the Church get the 50 G in the first place? The fucking Church is the biggest scam going. You know what's the real killer? It costs $8,000 per kid for them to go to parochial school. I've got three kids in there already, with two on the way! Christ. That fucking reward is my money, man! But that's Church policy. The Pope is the world's biggest bookie. Makes people bet on their own salvation! Double or nothing on Heaven. You go to Hell -- then go to Hell. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was bullshit. I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would. Susie's not a virgin anymore. She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ. And the nun's not a virgin anymore, either. Will they make her leave the convent? Who knows? Who knows what their policy is. reverence) But I'll tell you, man, that nun... She was beautiful. Just beautiful... Tall... Real tall... I've never seen anything like it... He's not in. LT leaves ARIANE'S NUMBER on LIMELITE'S BEEPER. Hangs up.  Lite, man... Where the fuck are you? It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ. Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns! the move with intensity and bravado. entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh longer than LT did. CHEST. Do you believe in God?

Don't give me any hassles, man. Just put in my bet. 30 G's. Yeah. And I got $900 from the cops on Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry's gonna knock em dead. Of course he is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have faith, man! OK. Right. speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic continues throughout the scene. Do you believe in God? The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God? What's to believe? That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins. Your sins, Lieutenant!  And look around you! Where do you think all this shit came from? before she hurt him. People. You believe that man is the be-all and end-all? Yeah. OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God? As if in answer.

We're on our way home, now! Yeah, yeah. Now why don't I just call up your Aunt right now and tell her what's gone down. How about that? The GIRLS are petrified. a JOINT with their POT.

INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first, The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved crosses on her. In the background, the questioning has already begun. The interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it. ring. Can't you tell us anything? Sisters? Anything at all? The ELDERLY NUN speaks up. They broke my glasses. I didn't see anything, but I did hear them. They were young. And there were two of them. They spoke Spanish. One of them was named Julio. LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his commentary  Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics named "Julio". The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed. I would tell you more if I could. I am so sorry, Officers. Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS what they want. What about you, Sister? Won't you tell us anything? to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her defiance gives him even more pleasure. The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition -- this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he pontificates. Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years old. I'm not from this Church, of course, but I assume they'll be getting her a new pair of glasses. Apparently she's legally blind without them. The Sister who suffered a rape is just 17. She arrived from Ireland only a couple of months ago. This -- event -- is just too much for them to take! The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a dicitous tone. Listen. The Church would like to know who did it just as much as the NYPD. These arrant criminals broke the laws of man, and the laws of God. The Church wants nothing more than to see them behind bars. That's why we're offering the $50,000 reward to whomever brings them in. I'm sure our hero will be one of New York's Finest. The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look. It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact with LT. But he can't be sure.

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil. Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't -- The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a strange, low laughter. Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God? It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt. I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God? I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer. As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father -- Yes, Sister? Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina. Outside the CONFESSIONAL. LT reacts to the explicit word. Shock. Titillation and fascination. Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys. You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew? Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens. This could be the clue he needs to solve the case. I could tell you their names now, and I know you'd be bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret. But I cannot tell you their names. For I, too, am bound. As I am bound now to confess my sins. So listen, Father Listen.  I am a nun. What did I give those boys that they could not have found elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all. There were always two of us in the act. The act was half my own. It does not seem to me the act was half the act of a once of Christ.  It is the lost chance that will remain on the ledger of my sins. Not the loss of my virginity. The rape forced upon me a choice. As a vessel of the spirit. I could have imbued my vagina with God. Or, I could have turned away from God and voided my body of spirit, so that all that was left for those boys was a lump of flesh. I chose the second path. The easier, path. The path of the material world. The path no nun has the right to take. And so, I sinned.  My vagina spread, but spread no word. It opened, on nothingness. It gave nothing at all and left nothing behind. No trace of my act, yes my act. For I was there, too, remains in the landscape of God. The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent paradox can find unified expression in his character, though at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny. Jesus turned water to wine. I ought to have turned bitter semen to fertile sperm -- hatred to love. And maybe to have saved their souls. They did not love me. I ought to have loved them. As Jesus loved those who reviled him. I ought to have surprised those boys. Instead, they surprised me, and got no surprise at all. No, they did not rape a nun. But a nun has been raped. And the nun must now atone for her sin. For a God-given part of her was wasted. A part which other women use for procreation, for conjugal fulfillment, for expressions of love. I had but one chance. And I did nothing but react in pain.  When those boys placed their hands upon my breasts, they had nothing but an assortment of skin cells in their grasp. They ought to have felt, through me. The bosom of their Redeemer. When they lay on top of me and looked down into my eyes, they saw fear. They should have met the eyes of a lover, And felt the presence of the Prince of Peace...  My vagina. I shall never have again. And never again shall I encounter two boys whose prayer was more legible, more poignant, more anguished. Two young men who threw themselves upon the altar and took me with them. And I did nothing for them. I can only hope that someone will. knew he was there and cried out to him.

A GRANDMOTHER pulls him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH. On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT down with him. On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE. It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking. INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT A cheerful apartment.

That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE and HEROIN. They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic connotations. When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds, sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there. Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES. Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters. Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic. Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this -- The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes who it may be. He slowly answers the phone. another world syllable by syllable.  Large?  All right, cop.

Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. Yeah, sucker. You better be there! Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...

You mean you could use it. captivating, impossible idea. As he speaks, he speeds more and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue twister perfect. I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win! "The Strawberries"? The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to -- they've overlooked.  How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?  I'm a Catholic. LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of his dose kick in but good. He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out the morning of the desecration. Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close. As it was that morning only four days ago, the SUNRISE is blood red.

The other cops'll just put the guys through the system. They're juveniles. They'll walk! Get it? But I'll beat the system and do justice. Real justice. For you. The NUN turns to run. I have already forgiven them. Come on lady! They put out cigarettes on your tits, man! Get with the program! Don't you want them behind bars? Or away from the world for good? How could you forgive these motherfu -- excuse me. These guys. How could you? Deep down, don't you want them to pay for what they did to you? Don't you want the crime avenged? I have forgiven them. Nun! These boys still have their weapons, Sister. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if they do it to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do you have the rights let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden. Sister? The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple. I have prayed for days, Lieutenant. I have prayed for the souls of the boys who raped me. And I have prayed for my own soul, too. I know what I must do. And I know what I must not do.  But you -- you -- it is you who needs to pray. Now, why do you want to kill these boys? Why -- really? tack) Look. Sister. No one has to get killed. We can solve this together. You and me -- as one. These boys are lost sheep. Both Catholic -- did you know that? And they're sick, Sister. With a stress of the mind and of the soul. They need help. Not just jail. Not just psychiatry. They need the help that only the Church can give. Please help me to help them. Help me find them before the others do. The night is full of evil men, chasing these boys with guns and clubs. We have charity and love on our side. I know that together, we could find them first, even in the dark... The good reasons are not always the real reasons. Talk to Jesus, Lieutenant. Pray.  You do you believe in God -- don't you? That Jesus Christ died for your sins? This blows him away. He has nothing to say to that. The NUN has finished her morning prayers. For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes. Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH. transfixed. Soon, LT hears a VOICE. to someone he's known all his life.  I forgive you. Me?  I forgive you. You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad. I forgive you. Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that. Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS, and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR. I forgive you. Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me! I forgive you. Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why? I forgive you. Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I -- stumbles, struggles, pleads.

It's still goddamn good to be good. I forgive you. EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH!

The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to you! Tell me where the fuck you got it! Take me there! Now! At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea. Then breaks into TEARS. She speaks at last. I can't tell you. Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees. In the name of God, you must. My husband will give me Hell, Mister. We've already got Hell, Sister. She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly, she tells him what he needs to know. It's very hard. He's a -- you're not a cop, are you? No. Not a cop. My husband is a fence. He got this chalice from a couple of kids. Just yesterday, I think. I stole it out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be. It's a holy thing, you know. A holy thing. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced. A holy thing.  Let's go. Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the way out. Manages to carry both items. When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside, they both pause to GENUFLECT. Then LT grabs her again and they rush out. EXT: AFTERNOON - BARRIO STREETS - EN ROUTE TO THE FENCE toward the FENCE'S SHOP.

And then it made it's way back to me, again. Yes. Th» FENCE bursts out LAUGHING. Are you all right, honey? I was gonna bring it back myself. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved. Jesus, woman! What did you think? You thought I'd get mad like I did that time you took that set of pots and pans? That was twenty years ago. And how do you compare pots and pans and a chalice? They both hold stuff you eat. After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins in.  So what are you doing here? He wants to know who brought in the chalice. That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand? head) No. How could you understand. The FENCE seems to study LT. The FENCE thinks again. Well -- maybe you do. But I don't know where those boys are at right now. You'll have to ask around. Those boys on the corner'll know. You'll have to get it out of them. But they know.  Thank you. And I'll make sure the chalice gets back where it belongs. EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE "JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE, asks them if they've seen it before. No one has. he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere. The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing. Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops. The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes down in mime. Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard. Hey -- Have you seen Paolo or Julio around? The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting "deafness" to excuse his total lack of response. response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout. The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from his ears but doesn't take it off. What the fuck you want. You know, my Uncle used to wear a walkman all the time. The walkman looked just like yours. And you look something like my Uncle. But one day he was standing in a puddle -- the puddle locked just like that one -- Standing. And what? And he got electrocuted. The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react. Look -- I don't know you, and you don't know me, but I'm really in the mood to kill someone today and you are at the end of my gun.  Have you ever had days like that? Yeah, you have, so now you understand where I'm coming from.  Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo ? The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all it was about? No problem. They were at that abandoned building last night. Second floor. They're probably still there now. It's next to the old Convent. Downtown a ways. You know the place... CU. LT - It hits him.
