A screenplay by Paul Mayersberg Shooting Script INT. CASINO - NIGHT A roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK? JACK'S VOICE Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune. A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against the spin. Hands, faces, chips... JACK'S VOICE The world turned round him... leaving him miraculously untouched The little white ball circles the spinning wheel. The PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes are on the bouncing ball. JACK'S VOICE The croupier had reached his goal. He no longer heard the sound of the ball. The back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face... JACK'S VOICE To begin with he was Jack Manfred... whistling sound takes Jack back in time. INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face. He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on the open is GILES CREMORNE. INT. GILES' OFFICE - DAY comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless, he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot machine. Take a pew, Jack. You look well. What's it been, two years since we broke bread? manner. Three years, two months. March '93. What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa? She went back to South Africa.  Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time. We all played the field. phone buzzes. He picks up. Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...  I want a job, Giles.  All right. As what? I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you? We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds? Sorry. This is a no-smoking office, Jack. You've written a book, haven't you? I didn't read it myself, but -- A WOMAN SECRETARY puts her head into the office. Give me ten minutes, Fiona. Fiona used to read for me. He winks at JACK. Let me tell you about our operation. We like personality authors. People the public recognises. Celebrity's what sells books. We can always find someone to do the writing. First, we need the face. Then the concept. fax) Right now I'm looking for a soccer novel. Something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top. Seven figure transfer fees. Corruption all down the line. Violence on and off the pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages.  The pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages.  With plenty of sex, of course. waits. Interesting, Giles. I will think about it. The machine spits out several coins. GILES takes them. Let me give you three words of advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick with it. Who persists wins. That's my motto. Write, write, write. JACK'S VOICE Jack had three words for, Giles. Go fuck yourself. Meeting over. GILES smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine winnings. INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - SITTING ROOM -  DAY The untidy evidence. To the accompaniment of the music, a discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention Of The Wheel', A Novel by JACK MANFRED. Worn furniture. A pile of literary magazines. Two elegantly arranged vases of flowers.  Women's fashion magazines. Books everywhere, including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of A Poker Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin. A woman's dress, back from the cleaners. A framed etching of Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century. Finally... Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table. In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter... EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY A MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON: his hands.  It is impossible to tell where he is. He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and searches through for something. EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform. On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer than the one before, until... INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY The phone rings. JACK looks to the answering machine, waits for the voice. MAN'S VOICE Jacko, if you're there, pick up. I want to talk to you. It's important. Dad, I'm here. EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY The MAN is handsome, tanned, 50ish, white shirt, dark tie. He is JACK'S father. How's it going? The subsequent conversation is INTERCUT between SITTING Great. Found a job? No. Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier. That's not what I want to do, dad. cigarette) Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...  It's not that. I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break. All right, I'll think about it. I won't. Goodbye, dad. Just do it. You've got the knack, you've got the personality, you got that from me. You understand the punters. Think about it, you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid. As he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN. For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.   All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him. on a pad. So how are you doing, dad? Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that Yes, I know that. Don't let yourself down. I won't.  Goodbye, dad. INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY Stubbing out his cigarette, JACK SR. leaves the booth. We now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting.  Sorry to keep you. What'll you have? INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY JACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY... JACK'S VOICE Jack knew something was wrong. He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles said three words. BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment... JACK'S VOICE JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right... He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud. DRUNK'S VOICE I want to fuck the whole world over. INT. CASINO - DAY Reception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and moves towards the front door. JACK'S VOICE Welcome back Jack... to the house of addiction. The door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY late forties, dead behind the eyes. David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John. Jack. You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?  Has he? In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you? No. Where did you go to school?  I was at Beadles. I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose. INT. CASINO - HALL - DAY The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking. There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us. Do you have a Salon Prive? We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company. Let's see you handle the chips. He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying denominations onto the table. I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond. We check every four days. Why four? And not three or five?  It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips. pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast. In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked. Stacks of 20. Rows of 5. Any exceptions? 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours. Give me 365. He presses a stopwatch in his hand. JACK quickly sets out four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles are in denominations of ten and five. Very good. Now take these colours... He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table. The blue are 10, the white are 5. I want 780, but I want 500 in denominations of 25. ticking watch seem slow.  Very good. INT. CASINO - DAY Now at a roulette table, REYNOLDS has prepared the bets for fifteen punters. It's a set-up to test Jack's style and concentration. REYNOLDS gives JACK the white ball. You use two alternating, don't you? We do. ball)  Where's the magnet? They've been tested. No more bets. As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, REYNOLDS turns to a CLEANING LADY who's emptying some ashtrays nearby. Could you stop that for a minute? The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line. I'm sorry, sir, I've called no more bets. wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The ball stops. 23 Red. Odd. He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23. It's all very efficient and speedy. Haven't you forgotten something?  I don't think so. Wipe your hands. Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched. What happens if I want to sneeze? You won't. Not without permission. Fine. Now let's move on. INT. CASINO - DAY A blackjack table. JACK is turning cards over for five punters in an arc. REYNOLDS is moving from one chair to the next playing each of the five hands. How many aces are left? Five. I make it six. Five. What makes you so sure? It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. Good call. You want me to check?  I said good call. watch out of his pocket, glances at it. JACK'S VOICE It had taken him 45 minutes, but Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number. The man couldn't count. INT. CASINO - OFFICE - DAY Back in the office REYNOLDS is talking to JACK. On REYNOLDS'S desk is a framed photograph of his suburban wife and two kids. Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. What for? For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. I don't gamble. Ever? I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds. Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden. We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check. This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does. Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it? We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished. How? First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you? Girlfriend? Yes. She's not in the gaming business is she? No. INT. CASINO - "CROW'S NEST" - DAY A CCTV Centre over the casino. JACK crosses the room, looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino below. REYNOLDS walks over to a series of twenty or more banked TV monitors with many Video 8 tape decks. This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again. Very impressive. We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something. monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where a WOMAN is cheating. REYNOLDS freezes the frame. See that?  That was six weeks ago. The dealer missed it. The guy up here missed it, but I watch these tapes after hours. Nothing gets by me. Now the lady's in jail. It's easier to take ten million pounds from a bank than take one penny from this casino. INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY Again in the office. REYNOLDS extends his hand. JACK shakes it. You can start Monday week. Fine. That hair will have to go. Fine. Pause. Are you planning to make a career in casino work? JACK'S VOICE And end up like you? I just want the job. Jack, you're not the usual type we get here. JACK'S VOICE Mr Reynolds was right. It was true. Jack was up above the world. An artist, living in the clouds. Looking down. A HIGH ANGLED SHOT of the office, JACK and REYNOLDS. The phone rings. Excuse me... I can't talk about this now... no, I'm with somebody. They can wait! I'll be home at the usual time... all right, I'll call you back in an hour...  Don't ever get married, Jack. Casino work doesn't mix with house and garden. Any questions? The CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up. Yes. What's the salary? EXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a Sixties Austin-Healey. JACK'S VOICE The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears. He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque. He needed money now. EXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking round jack's car, examining it.  What kind of deal you looking to? What's the Blue Book price? That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition. JACK'S VOICE The car was a gift from Jack's father. That's to say, Jack Senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived. The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust. This ain't exactly what you'd call mint. He bends down and looks underneath the car. How about fifteen hundred? How about five hundred. What?! How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty. Is that your idea of arithmetic? I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business. Eight-fifty. Seven-fifty. The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks. JACK'S VOICE He suddenly wanted to be rid of it. 'Hang on tightly, let go lightly'. It was a saying Jack remembered. cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins... INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT ... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette, in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, Self-Help, Cooking.... JACK'S VOICE Jack imagined people reading his book. One day he would enter their heads, play with their imaginations, test their feelings... EXT. STREET - NIGHT Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street. JACK'S VOICE He would tell them you have to make a choice in life. Be a gambler or a croupier. And then live with your decision come what may. He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind him. INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT street sounds and a dog barking. JACK'S VOICE Marion saw life differently. She was a romantic. And thought he was too. INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to the open bathroom door, from which comes the music. INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away. a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black knickers. I couldn't resist them. You mean I won't resist them. No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer. You want me drunk?  I won't be that long. She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards the door. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT door, not quite closed. JACK tosses the knickers onto the bed. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours a glass of wine. INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT window he sees women's legs passing on the street above. On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine. made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black shoes, a black scarf around her neck. You really are a beautiful woman.  It's not just inner beauty, is it? Turn around. You're all I desire. He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes inside. Where did you get it? I. sold the car. You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you. I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another. Take it back. Till you sell your book. Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it. Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you. She raises the glass of wine, drinks. I'm not much of a bet. He drains his glass. You are to me. She takes her scarf, puts it round his neck, pulls him seductively towards the bedroom door. Come into my world. She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his eyes.  You're my prisoner. I've got something to tell you. I want to hear it. I've got a job.  What job? him. In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer. How did you land that? It came my way. 450 a week.  450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training? I had training. In the Republic. You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. I start Monday week. From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm. 450 a week. I've never earned that in my life. You're an enigma, you are. A fucking enigma. JACK'S VOICE Not an enigma, just a contradiction. You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. I love you Jack, you know that. JACK'S VOICE And he half-loved Marion. And she knew that too. Outside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it. Are you trying to read my palm? You've got such beautiful hands. JACK'S VOICE The hands of a conjuror, a woman had told him once. Or a card sharp. Their hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom. INT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY JACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST. What line of work are you in? I'm an undertaker. Really? The MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with curiosity. INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY A BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black. Do you work round here? My office is in Shanghai.  What do you do? I'm an arms dealer. The BARBER stops for a moment, nonplussed. INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - DAY In front of the mirror JACK buttons a white shirt and skillfully ties a black bow tie. His short hair is lacquered back. He reaches down for his black jacket... puts it on. The transformation is complete. As he scrubs his nails, JACK sees a WOMAN in the mirror. She is changing her clothes. She pulls off her Indian cotton dress. She's wearing pants but no bra. Quite unselfconsciously, not looking Jack's way, she dresses in her casino clothes. I'm Bella. Jack Manfred. Hi, Jack. the uplift bra) Welcome to the cesspit. Is it that bad? her top) How do I look? JACK'S VOICE Like trouble, Bella. You look fine. The punters love it. Tits in uniform. She laughs. INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT him, not recognising him. JACK'S VOICE The usual bunch. They didn't know Jack, but he knew them. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK. Where's the other fellow? Where's Geoff? He doesn't work here any more. Well, let's hope you know your job. A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN trying to look as young as possible throws 100 pounds in cash to JACK. Tens, please. She turns to the WOMAN next to her, who looks very similar. Perhaps this man will bring us luck. The WOMAN has sensed her friend's interest in JACK. She's jealous.  What's that aftershave you're wearing? JACK'S VOICE Never converse with the punters. It slows things down. Speed is volume, and volume is profit for the casino. Aim at twenty spins an hour. background REYNOLDS is watching as JACK spins the wheel. Last bets, please. INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT Later. A plastic-looking BLONDE WOMAN, heavily made-up, sits at the table. She nods to JACK. PUNTERS are placing their bets. She has 50 casino chips of £100 denominations in front of her. JACK notes the large sum. The BLONDE puts £2,500 on red and £2,500 on black. PUNTERS round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and the strangeness of betting both red and black. red loss and moves it across the table to the black win. The BLONDE picks up the £5,000 without a reaction and leaves the table. A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him: You're new here. You'll get used to Madame Claude. She comes in once or twice a week and does that. JACK'S VOICE He knew the scam. Come in with five grand cash. No questions asked. Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in. Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it? After all there's was no profit in it for the casino. Or was there? INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to hand you over now to my colleague. Goodnight. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Good work, Jack. You handled yourself well. At the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man. INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves. JACK'S VOICE Suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him. INT. CASINO - NIGHT Across the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5 bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table. Why don't you take a break, Jack.  All right, Mr Reynolds. He moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR Good evening, Mr Tchai. Good evening. Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.  Your usual, sir? Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game. JACK'S VOICE £50 for a diet Coke. Waitresses were the true winners in the casino. They were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips. On a good night they could get between £200 and £300. The WAITRESS goes. The other PLAYERS at the table look at INT. CASINO - NIGHT Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. Does he win?  He's a good customer. JACK'S VOICE A good customer is a consistent loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds meant? INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT Where do you live, Jack? Over the river. Have you got transport? I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like. Thanks. INT. BMW - NIGHT him. So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high. Nice car. She's my baby. How long have you worked at the casino? Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months. You've done pretty well.  Not bad. I have other interests, of course. I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax. No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours. I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that. Some other time. INT. FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT bed. She wakes. What's the time? I don't know. Clock beside the bed reads 4.30. How did it go? Fine. He gets into bed beside her. She takes him in her arms. You're shaking. What is it? Tension. It'll go. Poor baby.  This'll relax you. She starts to massage his neck, his hair. I loved it blond. It's only hair. I haven't changed. INT. BEDROOM - DAY her nightgown into a laundry basket. JACK is asleep. She bends to kiss him. He wakes. When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.  I'll see you in my dreams. INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight illuminates the old etching of Cape Town. INT. CASINO - NIGHT expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK ten £50 notes. In 20s, please... He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then counts out £500 in £20 chips. He slides the chips towards her, looks at her. She smiles. There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC- the front of her dress.  Place your bets. Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls the numbers: 5...8...11. JACK'S VOICE Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler. Professionals always place their bets through the croupier. That way there are no comebacks. The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel again. 33 comes up. INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip to the square. JACK clocks it. I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.  What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.  You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. I put them on together. I'm afraid that's not so, sir. REYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting angry. JANI watches. Now look here, you... Is there a problem, sir? Yes. This croupier is accusing me of cheating. It was a late bet. This gentleman has been following the lady's numbers and... The MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm.  Do you think I cheated? In my opinion... it was a late bet. I think we should talk about this, sir. Away from the table.  No. I won. I want to be paid. He bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK. Pay the gentleman. In full. leaves the table. her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up to leave. I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.  You know where I'm from? I've lived there.  Well, thank you anyway. JACK'S VOICE Bright woman, he thought. She knew the rule of gold. Quit when you're ahead. with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance. He looks back to the table. Place your bets. On his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes an occult sign with his hand. INT. CASINO - NIGHT It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S winnings, quickly and efficiently. piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his winnings and leave. INT. BMW - NIGHT Again MATT is driving JACK home.  Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.  What the fuck are you talking about? That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.  I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. I'm not going to report it. What are you, a cop? If I see you do it again, I'll report it. I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. You're talking about complicity.

I'm from Cape Town originally I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast. Near the casino. In the casino. Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. Your father?

This gentleman accidentally coughed onto these chips. I don't think it would be hygienic to stack them... The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over. Agnes.

For JACK, a continuation of the violence with the MAN on the street. For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp. He rips her black underwear away. INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Later. JACK is lying sprawled on the bed with BELLA. She reaches across him and retrieves the fallen lamp. It's funny, isn't it?

In the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the bedroom. I'm getting there. It's good to have the job to fall back on, isn't it?  There goes my other phone. Goodbye dad. He hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript. She's finished. INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT puts the typescript down. JACK waits. I don't like it. Why not? I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --  -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Marion. It's a book. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it. It's the truth. Without hope there's no point to anything. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same.

A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.  Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt. You're all scumbags. I agree.

The Honda stops next to them. INT. HONDA - NIGHT off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised. There's no point pretending it was an accident. I had a fight with someone, that's all.

One more remark like that and I'll break your balls. There is silence. GORDON is embarrassed. FIONA looks at CHLOE, they're shocked and impressed. JACK smiles.  I'll bet she could, too. I'll deal, but I won't play. He sits down, picks up the cards. You sure you know how? shuffles by pressing the two halves together open-palmed. There is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been shuffled. FIONA and CHLOE are fascinated. Do that again. immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards from JACK'S right hand, flicking across the table. As the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another in front of each player. That's sexy. At the end of the deal, five players are looking at a neat fan of five cards before them. Don't they look pretty. They all pick up their cards.  There's nothing pretty about this hand. You're not supposed to talk, Giles. He's probably lying. He does that. INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT Later. JACK deals the cards. Last hand. Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...  No! No stripping. Right. We're not having that again!  Although... I'll stick to bluffing. That's what I'm best at. She looks up at him and cuts the cards. JACK deals the cards deftly. The FIVE PLAYERS pick up their cards.

She looks round the room. JACK'S VOICE Here was an interesting question. Was writing work... or play? She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing. From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas. He glances at the open bathroom door, then climbs into his pajamas. He has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with the ARABIC MAN. What happened? Remember the guy who cheated at the table? You don't like cheats, do you. She walks across to her case, opens it, rummages around and takes out a nightie. This, without the slightest hint of embarrassment. JACK goes into the bathroom to brush his teeth. JANI climbs into bed. Which side do you like?  You choose. They get into bed. That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before. It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it. I didn't. Then you're not a pro. JACK'S face. Goodnight. INT.

You don't have to do anything criminal.  Robbery's not criminal? You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen. You're serious. You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. And I thought you were only after my body. I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you. What'll you do when it all goes wrong? It won't. But if it does. You keep the ten thousand pounds. What ten thousand pounds? These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. Reynolds? You've done your research. She puts her hand on his. I didn't know what else to do. You're my last chance. She takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye. Next time it'll be my neck. What about my neck?

She moves from the middle to one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the charm. It's beautiful. Thank you. I hope it brings you luck. It will. shouldn't be together. That girl, she works at the casino -- -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? You're entitled to your opinion. It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches his shoulder. He opens his eyes. What? You were talking in your sleep. Not talking. Writing. INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE. JANI'S VOICE I need to see you. I've moved. I have a new number. It's 468-3275. Please call me. There is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes work. INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits. I want to speak to Jani de Villiers...  Jani... it's Jack... I'll come over now... He takes out a notepad and writes down the address. EXT. STREET - NIGHT street lamps are on. JACK'S VOICE Chapter Seven... Jack had decided to see her. The challenge was essential. He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in. INT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's pajamas. She looks unslept. Come in. She glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in. INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT room. It's not the Ritz this time. She switches on a standard lamp, looks at him. Is it yes? Yes. Thank you. Reflected in a mirror, she opens her bag and takes out an envelope, gives it to JACK. He looks inside. Four bank packets of £2500. It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place. Well, life's not fair. We know that. It's all relative.  I need the money too. Do you? Yes. The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.  That bruise has cleared up nicely. Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.  I've still got mine. And your hand too.  I took the bandage off yesterday. She crosses to pick up a bottle of Scotch. Would you like a drink? No thank you. other. I don't think we should meet again.  It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you. an arm around him. JACK'S VOICE There was a part of Jani he really liked. He turns and leaves the room. EXT. HOTEL - STREET - NIGHT JACK'S VOICE Question: Was he gambling, taking Jani's money? Answer: No. Because he wasn't betting with his own money. He was being paid in advance for a service... INT. CASINO - NIGHT At the roulette table JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball. JACK'S VOICE In reality there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange. One: the possibility the cash was counterfeit. Two: the possibility Jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed. A MIDDLE-AGED MAN is sweating. He fingers his last 2 chips. He reaches for a number, hesitates. JACK sees that the MAN's hand is shaking. JACK'S VOICE To begin with he put the odds at 2 against. 7 for. He checked a random selection of bills at a bank. They were all good. Across the table a well-dressed JEWISH WOMAN in her fifties is sitting next to a YOUNG MAN, a gigolo type, the top three buttons of his shirt undone. She too hesitates with her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty turns. JACK'S VOICE So now his odds were decidedly better. He put them at 8 to 1. The fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative. 2 minus 1. At the same time mathematically he had one more positive. 7 plus 1. The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the chip. Bring me some luck. The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21. The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays silently. INT. CASINO - NIGHT The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers. No more bets. The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm. JACK'S VOICE Next stage. He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up. The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure. The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face. winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he prepares to pay out the WOMAN. No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK. The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck. How about a drink to celebrate? The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief.  Cash me in. chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally. The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette table. JACK'S VOICE Jake's experiment with the man would prove the point. The MAN hesitates. He can't resist. In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down. JACK'S VOICE People don't change. INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT and bends to pick up the pieces. INT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest of drawers for another. She can't find one among the underwear. She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of £2500. She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously. INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him. JACK'S VOICE He watched their faces as they lost hour after hour, night after night, relentlessly. JACK'S FACE as he deals. JACK'S VOICE He questioned the conventional wisdom that gamblers are self- destructive... INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT The FACES of PUNTERS around the table: concentration, grimness, apprehension... JACK'S VOICE He had come to believe that in reality, they want to destroy everyone else - their families and loved ones, everyone. Fuck over the whole world... The white balls lands. The FACES of the LOSERS, resigned, desperate, angry.... The PUNTERS who are cleaned out get off their chairs, tear up their sequence cards, turn and walk away, quickly, slowly. JACK'S VOICE Without emotion he watched them go. Jake stayed. INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT leans over to pick it up, then doesn't. From the sitting room comes the message: JANI'S VOICE It's set. The day after tomorrow. The twenty-fourth. Good luck. Click. MARION gets out of bed. She goes into the sitting room. INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT carefully she presses the ERASE button, wiping the message. She goes back into the bedroom. INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY The little book charm dangles round his neck. Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?  Never. Why do you ask? I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time... Gambling's not about money. Really? Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds. She takes her hands away from his neck. I must be a fool. I never think about the odds. The sound of an underground train. INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the crowd. INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it.

He wears a silly paper hat. The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind them. They are gambling big money. Wads of £50 notes are changed into £100 chips. impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare to lose even more.

CASINO - NIGHT Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes. INT. CASINO - NIGHT The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight from the winners, 5 is heavily covered. The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number at the side.  Sir, I can't accept that bet. The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK. Are you calling me a cheat? You are a cheat. I saw you. lapel) I'm talking to you. fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They fight, trading blows. At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a hammer blow to the head. The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A strange, violent Christmas party. INT. CASINO - NIGHT watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy system: Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. There's no cause for alarm. Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas. REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has two large plasters on his chest. The NURSE finishes the job, smiles. There you go. She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK fingers the charm around his neck. There is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised. How did you know I was here? I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. She starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled. Did you go to the casino? Happy Christmas. They touch glasses and drink. Now...noodles or rice? As she opens the cartons, JACK watches her, still uneasy.  I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.  There was a message, wasn't there? It's probably easier for you to eat the rice. Marion!  What did you tell the police? Nothing about you. Then what? Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple. Here...use a spoon. Leave me alone, Marion. You're already alone. JACK'S VOICE He had always been alone. He had always believed it would make the decisions easier. All right. I don't want to lose you. I'll quit. I swear to you. Why did you take the money? I hate public transport. What? I want to buy a car.  How can anyone be that naive? INT. CASINO - REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - DAY How do you feel, Jack? Bruised. Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here... He hands JACK an envelope. What's this? He opens the envelope.

The year of your death. In the Book of Numbers the Lord said: 'thou shalt count thy steps'. There's a ring at the doorbell. He looks at his watch: 2.15a.m. The I ring comes again.

Who did it? Tell me! He grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands. We think it's a hit-and-run. A drunk driver, probably, But there is a possibility of a revenge killing. JACK'S VOICE  Revenge? For what? Whose revenge? As you know, she was a WPC with the Met. up until two years ago. Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights JACK'S Gitane. She called me last week. She'd got wind of a planned robbery at your casino. JACK'S VOICE What had that got to do with her death? You didn't recognise the man who attacked you, did you?  Of course I recognised him!  You did? I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. over MARION'S face.  Do you gamble? grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card. If anything occurs to you, call me. now filling out a form. From the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say something. JACK doesn't speak. I was in love with her, you know. There is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the sheet. EXT. STREETS - NIGHT In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets. JACK'S VOICE  'The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break, it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these, you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry'.

Standing in the doorway is BELLA, wearing a nightdress. She is sleepy. What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone? A couple I know are getting married. Fools. A whistling sound... INT. CASINO - NIGHT We are back in the FIRST SCENE. The ball bounces around the spinning wheel. The FACES of the PUNTERS. Frozen expressions. They are almost still. We do not see the croupier. Then...
