Written by Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor September 2007 - Eurythmics Sandra. My name is Sandra. Shut the fuck up.  2.  Putcher dick away... Get some.  3.  4.  Eat shit please.  5. VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds. Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN obliterated by another TRUCK.   It's creepy - robotic, but violent and too real - like a programmed suicide. Can't say I didn't try... We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to the peripheral. Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking aim; we SNAP ZOOM in... The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with: Shit! Shit! BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA. bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant - over KABLE's gear. Suckage.  6. Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES. Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a stray shot - PLINK! ... what the...! Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's QUICK... A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN. second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING DOWN. The battle is over - session complete. sequence... inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage. GENERI-CON's  are the street traffic that lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they are computer controlled NPCs ... petty thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences] A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from him.  7. NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD, dormant; they all knew it. The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind - we... Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed. Good run, Kable.  My name's Tillman. Whatever your name is. You got to the save point fast. So the fuck what? No one's getting out of here alive. I am.   I'm going to make it. The cynical BROWN just shakes his head. Sure you will. turning his attention to KABLE) They say you only got three battles left til you get out... The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE  8. A spartan, underground LAB. A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE; on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic FLIES. He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he could ever touch it. Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK. CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air. There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end. The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the lens up to his eyes. Switch to: examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO: A CONSOLE of MONITORS cut from FUZZ to GRAPHICS.         TECH GUYS and PRODUCERS scramble... it's SHOWTIME. Counting down five... four... three... two... door, to the CORRIDOR, where...  A REPORTER - GINA PARKER SMITH, sexy eager-beaver, focused - a NEWS EXEC, 40s, and a CHIEF OF STAFF, 60s are walking briskly along in a heated discussion. Do we have the damn interview or don't we?  9. We're cunt hair close - I can't blow off the Three-Asian War for "close". All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals... they care about Ken Castle - May I hear from Gina please? OK, Bob? Bob. You realize Castle has clocked exactly - one - media appearance to date and that was Walters' last interview before she died - NINE FUCKING YEARS AGO! Stop menstruating, just tell me we fucking have it - We fucking have it! The CHIEF OF STAFF bangs open a conference room door with his fist as they blow by - veers off and disappears. GINA rolls her eyes in disgust, keeps moving. Palindromes.  Hold on. Focus: let's get lunch. Sushi, Iranian, or Mexican? Burger chili fry?  I'll freak a burger.  10. GINA'S BURGER-FREAKING face becomes part of an ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE. A   LIVE with GINA PARKER SMITH In this context it looks like she's freaking serious world affairs. NOTE: this telecast will play much faster than the page count indicates - hyped up, quick cutting, overlapping dialog, A.D.D. and hyper-caffeinated. First... there was society... Shots of several dozen young, trendily dressed people talking trends that haven't yet been invented) wandering robotically around a BACKLOT-LOOKING CITY STREET, occasionally bumping into one another... the graphic society The ultimate SIM environment - where players don't control virtual animated characters - but actual, living, breathing human beings. People are dancing, MAKING OUT on street corners... someone tries to eat an ICE CREAM CONE, misses his mouth and pokes it into his eye.  They walked them, they talked them. They juiced them... A HOT YOUNG GIRL in a WET T-SHIRT is SLAMMING a BOTTLE of JAGER. They rocked them. A MIDDLE-AGED GUY in a shirt and tie is HEADBANGING FURIOUSLY like an extra in a TWISTED SISTER VIDEO. We all remember the slogan.  11. MONITORS, transfixed, doing a kind of sign language with their hands... JAPANESE lining up around the block... The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle, society took the world by storm, becoming the number one guilty pleasure of billions, either playing or watching... and generating one of the world's largest private fortunes, surpassing Steve Jobs and Bill Gates practically overnight. A FILE-FOOTAGE CLIP of KEN CASTLE - 30s, fresh and boyish, Southern molasses accent - being interviewed on a news show: I ain't complainin'! offset red and blue channels shifting. Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy - SLAYERS. walking towards CAMERA - BADASS, with BIG MOTHERFUCKING If society let us live thru others... others. Slick edited COMBAT FOOTAGE from the BATTLEFIELD. Explosions, flame throwers, bullet hits... DUDES screaming, unloading MASS ROUNDS... Slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being in full scale, kill-or-be- killed combat. And when we say flesh and blood, we mean flesh - A QUICK CUT of a BROWN'S ARM BEING BLOWN OFF.  12. ... and blood. An RPG EXPLODES - CHUNKS smack the lens and OOZE DOWN. translucent animated CHYRONS. CASTLE is older now than in the earlier clip; early 40s - his body is more solid; hair cut shorter, conservative. But the eyes still SPARKLE. Slayers.  Slayers. CASTLE'S accent is like pure Georgia honey.           He's a rock- ribbed charmer.  Why isn't it murder? She leans in, playing the role of hard-hitting reporter to a T. Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate -  ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal. I see - and has any one of these men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free?  13. I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.  What'd he say? ... in an election tainted by suspected digital fraud...  let's talk about the so-called generi-cons. VIDEO: a montage of slayers "civilians" - the bum shaking a can in the midst of chaos, a group of pedestrians walking robotically into a wall of flame, store clerks "air-bagging" groceries... Sent into the slayers environment with a set of pre-programmed actions, with no way to react and no one controlling them - their chances of survival are next to nil. There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session. VIDEO: the East Indian Female generi-con from the first battle gets smeared by a truck.  14. Right... TO: BULLET-CAM IMAGES of a SLAYERS SOLDIER leaping into action and freezing in MID-AIR, a GRAPHIC SUPERIMPOSED:  Mr. Castle - how the hell does it work? Simple. A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers. It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies... We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells. ... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex. The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.  15. Geek, geek, geek - come on, Castle, you promised us a demonstration.  Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see... A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick glasses, pony tails, etc. One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP. Meanwhile several OTHERS are directing HANDHELD SENSORS at slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in real time.  Oh... my god. So cute. You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch. Somehow, in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost acceptable. The CREW has a laugh off-screen; GINA blushes. I beg your pardon? This motherfucker is off the charts. You realize he could buy our network.  Why would he?   16. Son of a bitch can pull 650 million pay-per-views for a single broadcast. etc. GINA has her hands up, limp in front of her chin, like a submissive puppy begging, and she is PANTING; she's clearly getting into it... her every movement is MIRRORED by the adorable dog. That's fuckin scary. More COMBAT FOOTAGE, this time focusing on KABLE HIGHLIGHTS. Isn't it true that each human that undergoes the procedure will have a distinct IP address -- like a notebook computer or mobile device? Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments. You take Society for instance: once a cast member leaves the workplace they are completely free from the control and monitoring of their player.  That's a relief.  To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control? I don't... um...  17. Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it.  We will, Mr. Castle. We will. A SUPERNOVA FLARE throws to MUSIC and GRAPHICS: a LIVE Back to handheld, non-broadcast REALITY. changed; she's like a LITTLE GIRL with her DAD at the fair. Good little talk. My pleasure. Shit, can I tell you? I CAN. NOT. wait for the next Slayers. Kable has been unbelievable. His arms are just so... well, I know it's awful. What the hell is that? The WORLDLINK GRAPHIC GLITCHES OUT, replaced by a BLUE SCREEN - like an old school COMPUTER CRASH. THEN - One letter at a time, in retro Apple chicago font, accompanied by the exaggerated sound of COMPUTER KEYSTROKE CLICKS:  18. Then a VOICE - deep, but speaking ARTIFICIALLY QUICKLY - like in radio commercials, where they use time-compression software to remove the silences between the words. Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue. Everyone in the STUDIO is speechless, watching the monitors - including CASTLE; actually, he LOVES it... he's laughing his ass off. Mr. Castle, we have no idea... Shush! replaced by: Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES: final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in the ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged & sold as HAMBURGER. That's a God damn hoot.  Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes...  Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in.  19. Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall. The screen CUTS TO BLACK, COLOR-BARS blink, then an advertisement streams in.  What about your firewall, sugar - wonder if I might breach it one of these sunny days. He gives her a ROGUISH WINK. You're bad. He's good. On the monitors, we transition back into a paid commercial: a VICTORIA'S SECRET PORN-looking GIRL in HANDCUFFS turns to CAMERA. Wanna blow off a little steam? A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood sprays on white. We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in the same white powder - they look like tribesmen. One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        * enjoying the show. Fuck him up. The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant towers mark the perimeter.  20. Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind. The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops moving. The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain. A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners. They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive. In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes. Fingers run through white powder, making patterns. A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum; some sort of aircraft. the craft. He looks out across the yard. out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You... In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks expressionless. It triggers a memory... A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S feet... giggling, trusting... her hands grip his big fingers... taking each big ROBOT STEP with him... 21. A BASKETBALL comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS THE CRUTCH OUT from under the CRIPPLE, sending him ass-up on the asphalt. Prisoners JEER.  Kable. Kable. We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he runs his hand through it, wiping it away. A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look. My name is Tillman, freak. Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three. You never do know. All these niggaz gonna snap, snap, snap, one by one, every last one, all of em. Yeah but not you. Twenty seven battles and three to go... no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot... but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin, lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission, nothin' get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You spooky. Spooky.  22. Why they put you in here, Tillmans? I killed my best friend. A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls: Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams... At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone pushes through a wrinkled photograph. hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S vision. You want to get back to them. leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the picture. It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive. Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself. Who's talking? She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN. Sign it. What?  23. Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you. This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood. Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more. Why would anyone want my name? You don't even know what's going on out there, do you?  Damn... At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel. Gotta go. lifeline is slipping away... Wait. photo to the window) How did you get this picture?            Have you seen them? He peers through the little window at the top of the door, but she's GONE... Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was being beaten down.  24. eye contact with KABLE as he walks by.                                    * A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks... the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE. He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're side of a BUILDING. It's an AD for SLAYERS: KABLE in FULL KABLE, running - we're even CLOSER NOW... he's pushing himself beyond exhaustion, pure focus... Different city, same story - KABLE, a towering BILLBOARD PROJECTION... endless lanes of FREEWAY GRIDLOCK sprawling beneath... KABLE, staggering, near collapse, lungs burning... The ICONIC IMAGE of KABLE on the famous TIMES SQUARE VIDEO WALL, now even more massive... the STOCK TICKERS reeling off disaster... he's like GODZILLA frozen amongst the SKYSCRAPERS... doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath. long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE.  25. Hold for a long beat, and... shapes, colors and styles, but all RICH AND POWERFUL-looking. Some are sweating, some calm, some beat red, others have guitar-playing twitch faces... CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill. Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son. An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him... Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING swarming unit. From a wider shot, they look like flies on shit... after checking out the recently deleted, they zip off towards the closest save point... they've got SLAYERS on a wall-sized screen, pay-per-view... they're high fiving, SMASHING up the place...                                * 26. around the back of a burnt out building... Up a stairway - the GHOST FACE on GLASS superimposed on the image - the face is LAUGHING, GIDDY... Oh shit... oh shit... from here we see a small group of BLUES moving down the block, scanning for survivors. Wul hello thar... brings up a SNIPER SIGHT and locks in on a target. Wait for it... CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST OF seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the sights. We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless, trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.  Turn me around God damn it... What'd he say? A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control. POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out window. My boy gotta take a piss or something?  27. FINALLY: SNAP ZOOM on a reflection in a shard of HANGING D'oh. squeezes the trigger... The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise, blowing him out the back of the building... The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of seconds... behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR. He hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of                * the pavement, belching smoke.                                                * BOOM. The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD.                            * The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of A BROWN is sobbing uncontrollably. Who are they... who the fuck are they... who's playing us? MONTAGE, CLOSE UP: Two fat slices of WHOLE GRAIN BREAD, check.  28. Big sloppy spoonfuls of lumpy green ORGANIC PISTACHIO BUTTER, spread on SLICE A, check. Welch's PURPLE GRAPE JELLY spread on SLICE B, check. Combine; CONSUME. vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a vast, cold mansion. SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a 3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH SPACE. The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT sandwich intact. The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc. Everything dynamic, everything moving. One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name illustrates the point. In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention: A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR. he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by moving his fingers in the air. He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...  29. Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm. He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks it all down for us: Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance. A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY. Daddy like... An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT skinny, skanky, kind of hot. Simon! Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you. You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed. Uh huh. Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in. Simon, I just wanna play you. Forget about that star-fucker. Shut up bitch. a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL to the forefront.  30. Thanks baby. When can I meet you for like reals? What is that?  Aaaa. He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh, Woah. He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED. You like me? A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall. What's up, loser? Hey sissy. This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips, eyes and hair like a Tokyo hooker. Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer. Wanna make out? You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian. With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen. stupidly hot.  31. Simon? Maybe.  Oh my god, it's really you!!! Suddenly all of SIMON's screens are filled with the TWINS. Nice.  Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?  Uh, sure. They lift their shirts, GIRLS GONE WILD style.      Perfect perky C's with silver-dollar nipples. Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse. Here we go. When TWIN 2 speaks, it is with a MAN'S VOICE. The accent is Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice. Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.  Baby... make it a hundred. It's been real.  32. simultaneously. silence. Peace at last. D'oh. The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless, fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE CAM: Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun... What the fuh...? ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats. When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN. It's KABLE. A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time - we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video prank earlier: want to talk to him? Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall: WALKIETALKIE.exe Um. MUSIC: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch: Ha-ha, well now, we call this the act of mating But there are several other very important differences Between human beings and animals That you should know about...  33. You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel... lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us... We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING PARTY!!! We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter. On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS... A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED... People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on the ground... and in the middle of it all... CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow GIRL'S HAND... This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt, fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.  34. She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture. She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away. The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied with an elastic band. Hey. He smiles like a Driver's License photo. CLOSE-UP of LIPS, profile - by the looks of it, an OVERWEIGHT MALE... sweat, stubble. The ROOM is DARK - lit by the Hi. Hi. We will continue to CUT between the two locations. So what's your damage? He WINKS. then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY. GORGE/ANGIE You know, just hanging out.  Looking to meet people. Lucky you... 35. A CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. An extremely butch, masculine FEMALE; trace of a mustache. You met me.  You met me. hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the sidewalk. GORGE/ANGIE I'm Nika. DALE/GUY I'm Dale.  I like your fur. GORGE/ANGIE Do you want to go somewhere? She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time. DALE/GUY We are somewhere. He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS other. He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured prominently. She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary DALE/GUY  Thanks for vagina.  36. A SLAM OF AUDIO WITH THE SHOCK IMAGE OF A BLOODY, DEMONIC  ... the SCREEN GOES DEAD - ... and another BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH, another MESSAGE: - humanz We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all over the floor. automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals. The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING. ... a new video prank by the subversive group humanz caused a nationwide stir today... The TV REPORT continues on screen, where a NEWS HOST is backed by a graphic showing the "society is rape" screen with footage of exaggeratedly CONFUSED, FRUSTRATED PLAYERS - they're like the actors in INFOMERCIALS who can't manage to peel a potato without losing their shit. All contact between Society City and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over three hours while Castle techs worked to remove what they described as a "Satellite Infection"... A TREE LINED, SUN DAPPLED MOUNTAINSIDE whisks by as feet work the pedals of a MOUNTAIN-BIKE; we're moving around 20 mph.  37. SOUND: SLUUURRRRRRRP. a STATIONARY BIKE, and the NEWS REPORT is floating in the air as a 3D WINDOW. He is wearing skintight Tour de France-style gear and SLURPING A SMOOTHIE, one hand on the handlebar, the other holding the cup. Experts estimate   that the service interruption may   end up costing K- Soft billions in   lost revenue. Don't cry for Castle, he can cover that with the change under his couch cushions... On a personal note - that shit was fucking freaky. Oh - I literally pissed myself. Sounds like fun. Serious, these humanz cocksuckers are getting out of control, and someone should do something. Moving on to international headlines... SLUUURRRRRRP. The SCREAM would be comical if it weren't so HORRIFIC. With a dozen CONS looking on: an ASIAN PRISONER is on his knees, FINGERS DEEP into the back of his own skull.  38. He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED. through. What the hell happened to this one? An old black dude - LIFER - answers. Look like he escaped. The GUARDS roll their eyes; drag away the body. Back to your Jazzercise, girls... Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would look exactly like HACKMAN. ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least. Freak. Tillmans. Who the hell is that? New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...  39. Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD gestures him to follow. Hey Kable. Let's go. Upgrades. massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET... We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES. Who aims?  What? Who aims... the slayer? Or the player? Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye. That's tripped.  40. feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction. Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot.  But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way. Why? There's a delay... Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping... Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls - He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK. It's just me. SLAYER. We see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER: Hey. Kable.  41. from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away. Not interested. No. Wait. Look. He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are I just deleted someone. This is the blood. Look. nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement. He's back here. Want to see? Your head ain't on straight. I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday. Yeah, probably. That's why they put me here. KABLE'S eyes narrow - What? I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me...  42. You got two whores, Kable... If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT. - the fuck did you say? On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first... disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW... He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another... another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE? NOWHERE. The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three dimensions. He's so perfect. Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling, squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar to the one in SIMON'S room. behind him: He's scary.  43. We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared in the room behind him. Yeah... He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view - then turns to face his DOUBLE...  The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red...  He's so what they want.  But they love Kable. Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left. He's right.  They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view. How can you be sure? It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...  Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.  44. Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con... Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?  His instincts give him an edge. And in the hands of a talented player... Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him. Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... motion) You know, off camera? The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down. One thing I know is what makes people tick. Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He stares into the void, calm and utterly in control. The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK... 45. The black of the underground tunnel... the TUNNEL LIGHTS streak past like vanishing stars... TRAIN TRACKS blur by... Kable, dude. It's me. Who? Simon.  I'm playing you, dummy. We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans, centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION... ... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER - of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes. How come I can hear you? It's a mod.  46. Gamers can't talk to cons. I know. It's cool, yeah? A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and scrambles for better cover. No. Pay attention to the game. They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM. A 180 spin... BOOM.      MINUS three BLUES. In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE. mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT. This is real, this is real, this is real!!!!  47. SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement. That was sick. Wait a minute... are you twelve? I'm nineteen. Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet? Cause I'm a badass motherfucker. familiar face in the chaos: FREEK. dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he walks across the street.  Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint... It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire - the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do. An explosion nearby pushes them forward. Gibs. What? Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces.  48.  These are real humans, fucker. Death row psychos, so what?          They had it coming. An exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a collapsed building; it looks like it must've gotten the But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing underground. Guess that goes for me too. Yeah, but you're different. Different how? Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho. He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt, dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his weapon. The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving them two sets of eyes. Damn, new area. That way. They make for it.  49. Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run.  It's going to suck to see it end. Are you kidding me? Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different. narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat. Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL We should go that way. There's nothing there. Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.  Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried. They head the other way... THOOM. Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from the displaced air...  50. then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building. ... shit shit shit! He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact still raining down... and then: From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of hand; it skitters across the concrete. time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every move pings a step late... moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points the barrel at his    FACE.  Bye Kable. He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER... The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP. The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down- cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD. What happened? A BROWN CON walks slowly, on unsteady legs, out of the  51. dudes look at him and back away... when he turns toward us we see why: half his head, shoulder and one arm are blown off... BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel and throws him off.  Kid's gonna get me killed.  Hey. ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the mortar... session complete. speaks directly into SIMON'S ear: Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me. What the hell...? This is unthinkable, dangerous talk. Turn me loose, kid.        You want to win, turn me loose. But- Find a way. A GUARD grabs KABLE and the LINK BREAKS - we... 52. A drab brownstone apartment. Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell; even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her environment seems to parallel his. A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl in KABLE'S picture. She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom, looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking into tears. ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected advertising? searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7... ... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are on a wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers half the side of the structure... An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo, and superimposed in wall-height block letters: And then: 53. is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.  So... Miss Roth. warmth she can muster; it's not convincing. Why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child- Delia.   Her name is Delia. The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in her seat... torture. Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name. My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon... She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE. Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive. This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds all the cards. the paperwork) You're... an actor?  54. Not sure if I've seen you in anything. I work in society. Acting, is that what they call it? It's a job. but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE. Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything.  I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you? Yes, I do.     I'm her mother. The CASEWORKER presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind ANGIE. We will give your application all the consideration that it merits. The words burn into ANGIE like battery acid, but there's not a thing she can say. session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands. Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second - and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a unforgettable presence.  55. His style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s Black Panther Soul Brother transplanted into the high tech future. You like the software?  Software... The walkie talkie, playa. No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ. That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said? To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha? Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him? You were listening. We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game. Alright, then.  Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about? Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know. Huh?   What things?  56. Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out...  Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen. One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness. You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit. This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games. Mm hm. That's right, it's a game.  You want to win it, don't you? Yeah, dude, I intend to. Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa. Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct.  57. off. That... would be cheating. A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.  Uhhh... The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me? I do. I do feel you. Then let's rock, baby.  A WINDOW pops up on the screen: FreeNigga.exe  One light... HACKMAN'S FACE, glistening with sweat, is the only thing partially visible in the inky black... the CAMERA slowly ZOOMS into his EYES... twin pools of MADNESS... of MURDER... CLOSE-UP of the FADED PHOTO... gold hair, innocent laughter... KABLE runs his thumb across it tenderly, caressing the lines...  58.  Tillman. gave him the photo. You. We know you talked to him... your Player. You're not a guard... who are you? A friend. I don't have any. Listen to me: Simon's going to give you what you want. What you asked him for. How do you know that? I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it. We'll see. No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way. can believe them... finally: I need you to get me something.  59. What, Kable... what can I get you? looks up at the WINDOW in the door, a simple black rectangle - and on the other side, his only LIFELINE. Drunk. BLACK. Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN. He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell? He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. What's he got there? Kable, what the hell is that?! Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's CHAOS. Fuck-face - remove the `molotov' from your pants and discard into the recycle bin, now! maintain as the LIGHT slams into his brain, AGONY.  60. makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it - and joins the others rushing into combat. ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles bottom.  I can see turning you loose was a great idea.  What happened. control, you got it. WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA, which is kicking in INSTANTLY... No shit... Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up... An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING, He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his vision doubles and bleeds... What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something! BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING NOTHING.  61. This is unbelievable. definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE. A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet; the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting air...  Fuck it. We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. Too close.  Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together! Blow me. He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the Dammit! GRAVEYARD... Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT, another... his head hits a passenger side window,  62. FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY, PRISTINE. Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model, which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH A BUILDING OR TWO. under the cap is a prominent WARNING: Ethanol Only Kable. Dude. What are you doing? Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK. What the hell? He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING. His head is clearing. TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast. GO, GO, GO! Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?  63. VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!! He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT. 50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars. garage, disintegrating a concrete column. Fuuuuck!!!! He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in. shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA. The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture - now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA forward, next to the driver's window... The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head. Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!! window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way, barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the window of a building. Bye, FLY. 64. SIMON'S screen is filled with a GLITCHED OUT view of NOTHING, under a pile of glass and concrete. Um. The SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND. through and swerving around obstacles. going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps going.  Ughh, that was the one. view of KABLE... finally he comes across a RUMBLING CHASE CAM, coming up on KABLE'S truck from behind... The CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris. He SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it - despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP. the nearest PLOW... From the SNOWPLOW'S POV we see KABLE leaning out, POINTING  65. Shit, shit, SHIT! A shell comes RIGHT AT US - the screen GLITCHES, FREEZES - and goes BLACK. I'm dead. In KABLE'S REAR VIEW: The LEAD SNOWPLOW SPINS OUT, hemorrhaging black smoke; then SLAMS into the SECOND, sending it into the side of a building. KABLE'S TRUCK HICCUPS - FUEL is on EMPTY, but still charging ahead. A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY, smashing KABLE into his seat... Behind him, two SMART MISSILES are streaking high across the grey sky... they change direction and DOUBLE THEIR SPEED - it's fucking HORRIFIC... and CONVERGE on the downed TRUCK in an EYEBLINK. BOOM. ENTRANCE, which COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM. 66. The FRAT GUYS are standing there with their beers, frozen, mouths hanging open. On screen is a THREE DIMENSIONAL TEST PATTERN accompanied by a SEXY FEMALE VOICE: Please stand by... Please stand by... Please stand by... What just happened? The REPORT plays on a variety of PUBLIC SCREENS: To recap: initial reports are that Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon next to Ken Castle himself - is officially listed as fragged...  That's bullshit. ... just one session away from being the first slayer ever to win a full pardon and release. A drab, above ground commuter train; somehow reminiscent of the train to the slayers battleground - except the population here is strictly civilian: young, eccentric, mostly attractive, but their eyes are burned out, dead... lost. Dishwater daylight filters through the windows. The news broadcast continues, fed over video monitors that line the ceiling of the train. The passengers' eyes are glued to the screens...  67. In a NETCAST plagued by technical difficulties and dead spots the report could NOT be confirmed - however KABLE - born John Tillman of Albany, New York and convicted of murder just four years ago - has been removed from Slayers rosters and upcoming events listings. ... including, we reveal: ANGIE. She is stunned; her eyes well up with tears. No one notices. His player, gaming megastar Simon Silverton - could not be reached for comment. slayers is bad tv - humanz BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window. A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks, gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side. She's not home. black rimmed WEEZER glasses; SMART AND CUTE as hell... this is TRACE. But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough - trust me, you don't want to meet them.  You know, it's pretty obvious that you'd come here first. Who are you? You asked me that once before.  68. Your voice... We might recognize it too - it's the VOICE from the other side of the CELL DOOR. You should really come with me... She glances skyward toward the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS. ... like, NOW. They TAKE OFF on the MOTO, TRACE driving. There's an open doorway to the left - NEON SIGN above: adult xxx video 3D-ID novelty toy She CUTS HARD 90 degrees, straight into it, leaving tread on the concrete - through hanging black rubber strip curtains... and STRAIGHT DOWN A NARROW STAIRWELL, taking the stairs MOTOCROSS... She cuts HARD RIGHT at the bottom... ...down a concrete corridor and onto a minimal FREIGHT still idling... KABLE coughs from the fumes... Halfway down there is a SQUARE OPENING in the wall of the elevator shaft - a TUNNEL TO BLACK. Hang on.  69. A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete; classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON, CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons, giving it body english, racking up scores. at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s, long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK, CLACK... They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear to notice KABLE. You a fool. Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail. It's a game of deception. Whatever, that's cuz you got no power... finger - then LETS IT RIP - slamming the GAME WINNER in a 5.  Huh? What? Bullshit. You guys suck.  70. They turn, suddenly aware of him. HUMANZ DUDE'S paddle hand goes limp; the puck limps in and scores, meaninglessly.  Kable. Holy shit. His name's Tillman. Whatever.  You made it. You're really here. it wasn't this. You're the ones who broke me out? We only freed your mind. Your ass followed. Hey, Kable... business... DUDE is pure FANBOY. You're... great.  You got questions. A few. He glances over at TRACE. She took my blood. Why? The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain...   71. we can crack it, but it's not one size fits all; we needed your DNA to generate custom code. Alright.    Why me? Because Castle's scared of you. It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human. Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice. But this is only the beginning. Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line. So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again... This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us. The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse?  72. Hell no. They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves. We can't let that happen. Gotta bring the man down. You can help us, Tillman.  You have to help us. I can't help you. Tillman. in his tracks: We know where she is. fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Trying not to show how scared he is. The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup. The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls. When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational. Guess you remember that day.  73. You'd just gotten Kable through his tenth consecutive session alive... no one ever thought an I-con could last that long. Another photo shows SIMON on a JUMBOTRON posing with his fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control hand signal for FIRE and KILL... in another, he's being mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts with a black marker. Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King Player. Good times. Sure. On the outside.        Now look at these. A new series of graphic photos show bloody, mangled remains - the aftermath of a slayers session. This is what it's like on the inside.  Wonder how long you'd last on the other side of the screen. This SITS IN THE ROOM for a BEAT - SIMON considers several responses, chooses NONE OF THEM. Simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. The charge is... beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized - forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. Your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid detail...  74. In addition, your father's bank accounts have been frozen pending further investigation - naturally, seeing it was his money that essentially funded Mr. Tillman's escape.  I'm going to need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon. Everyone you talked to, everything you heard, everything you did. I need you to do that... right now. Yeah, um... I need something too.  Do you now? And what might that be? Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape. Dead silence. SIMON chews a HANGING CHAD off of a FINGERNAIL. Pistachio. They make that? It's awesome. ANGIE, in a white tank top and panties, is pulled to 3-D LIFE- in space. A FAT TONGUE wets FAT LIPS.  75. from slutty to sci-fi to quirky to casual, and back to slutty... as he SELECTS OPTIONS they appear on ANGIE, breathing BARBIE DOLL.

A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking. She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go, without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH? The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT FARM... green, glowing FIREFLIES dart through the air... people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow The usual? She just WINKS, flirtatious. The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE MARTINI... to finish, he plops in a LIVE, WHITE LARVA...  76. it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into it's pulp... She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue... swallows it down... as a GUY takes a seat to her left - his hair is shiny, slick black licorice. Hi Nika. Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?

Are you still a bad boy? minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind. They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT filter through patterned curtains. She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees, back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...  77. Urkk. She TURNS. - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT - KKRRUNCH. ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR with EMOTION. falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.

He pushes her hands away, gently. This isn't you. ANGIE'S eyes WELL UP with TEARS. RAGE) God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker.  78. GORGE/ANGIE I can't. GORGE/ANGIE  She has to say what I tell her.  You can hear me, baby. I know you can. He WIPES AWAY A TEAR from her cheek with his thumb.     After all he's been through he begins to BREAK DOWN. I love you... love you... GORGE/ANGIE I love you too.  He's SCREAMING directly at GORGE, who cowers in his chair as if KABLE were in the room with him. Say anything else and I'll find you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING PIECES, do you understand me? GORGE/ANGIE nods.  I'm getting you out of here. mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a ride. No sign of trouble.  I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program...  79. GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING.       The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open -  Hi, Kable.

And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes: GORGE/ANGIE Come on... do it... but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.  80. The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE. contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK. ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY. the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER.

This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES, the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP GEAR... wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN CITY... A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring- around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS. They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No... THOOM.   THOOM THOOM. disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO.

MUFFLED BLASTS, close behind... up more stairs, they SLAM through a SERVICE ... blinding DAYLIGHT. A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of them; the back doors SWING OPEN. I can get you out. Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN drives quietly away, attracting no attention. his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC, searching. I can't believe it's you. This is...  Listen: you can trust me, Kable.  If not...  83. He looks her straight in the eye. You're dead. CLOSE-UP: a LANCET is prepared... it PUNCTURES SKIN and SUCKS. breathing deeply...      TRACE pops the LANCET out of ANGIE'S fingertip and plops      a RED DROP into a glass tube of liquid. there. Now what?  The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.  It's an anti-spyware program. Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive. GINA'S not buying this I.T. GUY shit. Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out of me. That would be like cutting out part of your brain.   84. The nanocells replace the cells they replicate... they become you. How long will she sleep? We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears. Thirty minutes... you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot human. Tillman. We need to talk, my man. So talk. Come on. Primitive, 8-BIT ARCADE DEMO SCREENS: missiles obliterate a city in MISSILE COMMAND, line-vector TANKS track 3D targets in BATTLEZONE, etc. Ken Castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after.  85. rows of machines... the lights and patterns of 8-BIT DEMO They tested it on soldiers... the first volunteer was Corporal Travis Scotch - a friend of yours, I believe. They stop. Yeah. He was. The second was you. The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell, gradual... the new tissue would never break down, never deteriorate.  A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were doing the world a favor.  Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society. Thank you for the history lesson. Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know. I don't know what to tell you.  86. You ain't gotta tell me shit, Tillman.  I want you to show me. Slow PUSH IN on unconscious ANGIE. We hear TRACE interacting with HUMANZ TECHS off-CAMERA as a heart monitor BEEPS steadily. Alright. We're ready to rock. A sequence is punched in on a keyboard. Let's transmit in three... two... one... CLICK. With a GASP, ANGIE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. GORGE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. He SPAZZES OUT like a turtle on it's shell, a moment of panic - he's been PASSED OUT in his chair and doesn't immediately know where he is. He looks around the On the SCREEN, society is gone - there is only a nebulous Behind him, a SOUND. Hooz there? He runs his hand along the CHAIR'S TRACKBALL CONTROL, it CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes in the dark - scary.  What are you doing here? Who are you?  87. Tech support. A screen glitches - pixellated, fucked up, highly compressed, like an internet feed through a busted satellite. We begin to make out a coherent image: It is a POV, walking, of an industrial corridor.            Cameras mounted and doors with square glass windows. We back away from the screen to reveal - watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better. We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING? What are we looking at? His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data. I read something about this. But that tech is supposed to be a decade away... Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around. He bangs on a key, beating up the interface. They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy within 18 months. He is dead calm, emotionless.  88. Tiny SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS track his movements.            He comes to a DOOR; it whispers open and he STEPS IN. A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recognize it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: a MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM. Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille. Scotch.  Scotch.  I'll tell you what man: this place sucks. On the COMPUTER SCREEN: SCOTCH gestures to indicate the WHITE ROOM, the FACILITY...  They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day... nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add... What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being... they let you out already? KABLE'S response doesn't match SCOTCH'S energy - he's bland, generic.  89. I'm not getting out.  OK.  Tillman... dude. Are you good? I'm fine. Uh huh. You don't look good. I'm sorry. KABLE'S "sorry" seems to refer to something only KABLE knows.  Well, it's not like you ever looked that good... A BEAT.   SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE. KABLE'S eyes flicker away from SCOTCH'S. He calmly removes his military issue .45 from it's holster and lets it rest on the table between them. He stares at it intensely, emotion starting to seep through the icy lines of his face.  Tillman, what did they do to you? The IMAGE on the SCREEN begins to BREAK UP.             Hard to make out... What's happening? Through the OBSERVATION WINDOW we see present-day KABLE jerk and spasm in the chair. bead of sweat creeps down his forehead. It's apparent that he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle...  90. A low hum in the room starts to swell and throb, numbing, disorienting...  Tillman... It seems to take all of KABLE'S strength to answer.                His voice is halting, human - not robotic like before. I can't stop it... can't... KABLE'S eyes meet SCOTCH'S; they are red, rimmed with tears. Who are you? We punch in on a wall of TWO WAY GLASS behind SCOTCH, pixellated visual noise resolving to murky detail as we move in - we punch through the glass to reveal a familiar silhouette - I'm sorry... sent to SIMON: KABLE pulls the trigger, SOUNDLESS. SCOTCH falls over. Black blood pools. The humanz monitor GOES DEAD. Not the best commercial for K-soft technology.  91. ratings dancing in her head. You can say that again.  He made him do it.       Castle made him do it. A test. Everyone's eyes had been glued to it - now they look up, through the OBSERVATION WINDOW... The room is empty.       The CHAIR is knocked over on the floor; A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him: ANGIE. He touches her face, looks deep into her EYES - they are wet with emotion. It's you. She just NODS.    They embrace... finally, for real. I missed you... so much...  Delia. hair back - he searches her eyes, desperate with emotion.                * Baby... what did they do?                                   * I couldn't stop them.                                       *  92. Nobody could.                                                * Your daughter was taken into foster care by the state two years ago. The foster parent paid good money to remain anonymous... to make sure the girl would be untraceable. But there's always a data trail, if you know where to look.  We do. Where is she? I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy.  She's with Castle. leading to the UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS is right around the corner. Tillman! shoulder... he SPINS.  Wait. I want to come with you. KABLE'S eyes leave no room for doubt: not a chance. That's all the story you're going to get.  93. He BAILS, leaving her there. CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the crowd. But they're not after her... they head straight for the ALLEY. BLACK. A door opens, a switch is thrown... and SIMON is blinded by harsh fluorescent light. He sits up on a cot, wearing a white T-shirt and pajama pants; fucked up hair, groggy. He BELCHES. Alright, Silverton. Get up and get out. Cool.  Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat. hesitantly. It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns, by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of words, white on black: It's over. mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.  94. He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we last saw on GORGE'S screen. No link... no link. CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY. Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a soul in sight. cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE. He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central MANSION. THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES... stands to reason he's been MARKED already. He walks out INTO THE OPEN. The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN.              KABLE walks right in. The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no people of course. Could anyone possibly live here? He explores... A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself, playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk.  95. KABLE'S eyes go wide.        He starts to walk toward her, slowly at first... Delia... ... and finally breaking into a run - until: He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the glass... DELIA! ... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH SURFACE. Not bad for video, eh? The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be everywhere at once, intimate. The latest and greatest... defy you to tell it from real life. You imagine porn on this thing? playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED. Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long corridor - t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss... groove. He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny hardwood floor for DANCING. A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE. He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even real? And then CASTLE starts to SING... ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE: I've got you under my skin  96. I've got you deep in the heart of me So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me I've got you under my skin... He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN - from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES. they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE behind CASTLE... I'd sacrifice anything come what might For the sake of having you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night And repeats, and repeats in my ear... room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a ROCKETTE. Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away. Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality... But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP - before I give in Cause I've got you, under my skin... open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have taken care of that. break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out they're flesh and blood after all. combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS, right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands.  97.  You're awesome. Castle. Kable. They speak simultaneously: I don't care about you.               You don't care about me. ... you just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupido. My house, my rules. without concern, toward a side door. Come on, I want to show you something. Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile: background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE. I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH rising majestically in the dark heavens. Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention...   98. that was a genuine nuisance, no doubt about it... One thing even they didn't know, though: I'm wired too. CRAZY. I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago... They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on. At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in a FLEX BRACE. The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS. But mine's different.  Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in...  your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it. We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters... picks up the ball and resumes shooting.  Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.  99. walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER. You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates...  Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser. Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do. a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE... For instance. TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. but leaving his face UNPROTECTED... connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and a sickening POP.  100. SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it... life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back; he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S dead fingers. He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood. You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a shot.  I think you're missing the point, my man. No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this... ... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure. his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER... His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact. Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives... This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETED BY You're mine, boy. With a twitch of CASTLE'S eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG. dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life:  101. It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE.          CASTLE is stripping off his shirt.  Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll. Ummm. jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over. He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he backs away. Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he? KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his knuckles. Oww! perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH, strikes a pose to match. Lucky shot.  OK, not really. He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE to the floor. I need an audience, boys. A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see: close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.                         *  102. She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries            * to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her           * eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but           * oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.                   * That's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad... SQUAD, sheepish) Is this bad? I'm really bad. He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.                           * He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to               * ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel             * that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of              * what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking           * to KABLE for a clue.                                                    * KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and                 * gently touch her face... That's sweet. Alright boys, you ready? A true test. He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates. her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              * against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *  No. Just like last time. Remember? shaking...  103. You're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but I think the end result will be about the same...                                                       * Shh. The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He              * looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he                  * seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS                   * Suddenly: KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...  What the hell was that? The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. Not even KABLE understands this. There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address. Someone on the outside is sending him commands... His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND FORWARD... 104. ... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...  RETARDS!  Working on it... KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with everything he has... his strength and will overpowering CASTLE, but- obvious to a child) I think it. KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the knife away from CASTLE'S belly. You... fucking... do it... his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained... every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin & Yang, veins rising in his neck... Then KABLE senses an opportunity: Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real. course he can't help but picture it... ... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...  Oops.  105. ... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw           * her arms around her daughter.                                           *  YES!!! He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose... ... and KABLE does the same.                                            * Damn it, kid... draining life... they are FACE to FACE. ... is the fuckin pose really necessary? Sorry. KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor... then turns to face his family. When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S Georgia peach accent. Are you my Daddy Tillman? He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet, squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE with his other arm and pulls her in. The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug; pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs, get up and start to file out. Wait.  106. Shut it off. Pardon? The nanex.     Set us free. The GEEKS look at one another. It's nothing to you. A mouse- click. True dat. He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK: do it. The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile. Well played, Kable. fucking game? Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken? A VIDEO PLAYER WINDOW POPS UP: It's TRACE, filming        herself. This is for you, you dumb bitch.           I hope you do the right thing with it. The IMAGE switches to the CAPTURED FOOTAGE of KABLE in the military facility... leading up to SCOTCH'S murder. The light from the screen reflects on GINA PARKER SMITH'S face - she's wide-eyed, stunned.  107. Oh, baby... The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window glass. DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back seat. You good, sweetheart? his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back asleep. The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves into the giant sun.
