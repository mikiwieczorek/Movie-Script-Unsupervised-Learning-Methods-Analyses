The MAN's POV, as - - his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are removed. - his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses with a cloth. - his BLURRY POV then shifts  onto a - his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his nose, and - - with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the - Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin  to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his nose. finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING sound - "CLICK, CLICK, CLICK..." - ANGLE ON: HIS HAND, which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE... - then on a COMPUTER MONITOR , words form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU ...making sentences by these means. - OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS  of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR. We see...a TUFT of BROWN HAIR...his HAND on chair arm-rest ...his FEET on a wheelchair's foot-rests...JANE's HANDS arrange the BROWN HAIR...adjust his THIN ARMS...but never do we see the full man, as - - the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion the PARTY forward.  CONTINUED: putting the CHAIR in motion, to the sound of a small electric motor. EXT. CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY  ...the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHEN's BICYCLE, SPINNING VERY VERY FAST... , race each other recklessly through the NARROW, neck. And they are loving it. spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun- loving, playful, active, young student. BRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than studies, as we shall see. EXT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - DUSK running to a walk, crash their BIKES into a HEDGE. BRIAN wins the race, raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY. We follow them in... INT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ...STEPHEN and BRIAN enter, and the CAMERA finally follows them into the main room of the PARTY. - a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation. In the background suitably elegant music plays. First to find a drink. for the BAR. BRIAN eyes the PRETTY GIRLS he passes...  CONTINUED: I'm sure the secret of the universe has something to do with sex. There you go--why don't you do your doctorate on that? The physics of love. More your field, I think. You'd better decide on your subject. I'm serious--they'll boot you out. They reach the PUNCH-BOWL. BRIAN tastes the PUNCH with his finger, and UNIMPRESSED, fills TWO GLASSES. A YOUNG WOMAN, JANE WILDE,  arrives at the door with her friend DIANA. DIANA is unimpressed by the party. JANE, shy, has her hair up in a fashionable bouffant roll. Scientists! Don't worry. We don't have to stay long. Looks mortifyingly dull.  Oh, hang on--  Be right back, okay? Okay? off together with him into the crowd. At the PUNCH-BOWL, drinking punch. I applied for a job. Did you? Civil Service. Well, it's a back-up plan--in your case not a bad idea. Did they accept you?  CONTINUED:  now holding a WINE-GLASS. Unfortunately, that I'll never know. Morning of their exam, I... - slept in. Well, thank Christ, the world has lost a promising pay- clerk. still has his eye on JANE. BRIAN follows STEPHEN's GAZE as - - STEPHEN and JANE's eyes meet. They hold this look, until she shyly looks away.  Quo est femella? I was going to ask you. Actually--I think she's--yes-- Basil's sister. Wilde--Jane Wilde.  "So. You like for me I introduce?" take the DANCE-FLOOR and start DANCING. That's better. Who is that guy?  Oh. He's strange, clever, goes on Ban The Bomb marches.  Oh, there's David. Come on.  CONTINUED:  - STEPHEN, left alone, decides to slowly approach JANE. JANE has hardly touched her wine. STEPHEN has a beer. They look around the room together, and then - Hello. Hello. Science? Arts. More silence. They look elsewhere. So what do you-? Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist. What's a cosmologist? It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists.  You're not religious, are you? C of E. Church of England.  - England.  I suppose someone has to be. So--what do cosmologists worship then?  CONTINUED:   A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe.  Really? So what's the equation? That is the question. The NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING Few people remain at the party now. The tables are empty - the food is gone. The punch bowl is drained dry. Why didn't you stay at Oxford? My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them - What's a viva? A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again. They gave you the 1st. They gave me the 1st. - DIANA approaches.  CONTINUED:  This party is officially deceased! Come on--I've fixed you up a ride home. barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA. Well, I hope you find your equation. something in his hand, and then runs away. It's a NAPKIN. On it - a PHONE NUMBER. He stares at it, delighted, so much so that he taps one foot. INT. SEMINAR ROOM/TRINITY HALL/CAMBRIDGE - DAY under the table, while the professor, DR. DENNIS SCIAMA, , with a wicked smirk on his face, passes out a set of mathematical problems to BRIAN, CARTER, ELLIS, REES and several other YOUNG PHYSICISTS. A little challenge for you all, as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys -  - whatever they may be, Mr Hawking - Something to sort--the men from the boys--the wheat from the chaff-- the mesons from the pi-mesons--the quarks from the quacks--ten questions--each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it. Shall we say, Friday 3 o'clock?  This is going to hospitalize me. read the CHESS BOOK as he shuffles out of the tutorial. EXT. QUAD/ TRINITY HALL / CAMBRIDGE UNI. - DAY INT. STEPHEN'S ROOM/DORM, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY  Oh come on, get up. How many have you got? his answers. How many have you done? Morning, Brian. Afternoon, Stephen. Where are they? Where are you hiding them? Your answers. Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about. How many of Sciama's questions have you done? None. You liar! I was going do them later. Later? You mean you haven't even started? Beat. Stephen, are you aware you have voluntarily embarked on a PHD in physics at one of the most prestigious colleges in England? Yes. Oh, good. Thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something.  CONTINUED:  Bri-? What? Can you whip on some Wagner? Sod off. on his bed and yawns. He gets out of bed and turns on his ANCIENT TAPE-MACHINE. Later. Pouring milk into a cup of TEA, while listening to a his pyjamas, the dishevelled STEPHEN digs out the QUESTIONS from a pile of TRASH on his desk. First he finds all manner of chocolate wrappers, concert tickets, etc, until he finally settles down with a clean pad and a pencil. He looks at the clock. It reads -- 1:00PM. He sighs and looks out his window at teeming university life, as he ponders. He then starts to WRITE on a PAD, rapidly, effortlessly, the swift. Distracted, he then reaches for his TEA and clumsily KNOCKS He hurriedly wipes it off, but it's too late. He looks around for another pad, but to no avail. INT. SEMINAR ROOM, TRINITY COLLEGE - DAY The PhD STUDENTS are gathered, minus STEPHEN as SCIAMA hands back the classes answers.  John, this so illegible I'm not quite sure how wrong it is--I suspect very--and Brian...  ...that's just--baffling. Stephen, glad you could join us.  CONTINUED: Sorry. the TIME-TABLES down the desk to SCIAMA, who picks them up. Train timetables? Stephen, these are totally unacceptable--they expired a month ago. Laughter. Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident. and calculations. I could only do nine. End on SCIAMA and fellow students reaction - startled, speechless, everyone staring at STEPHEN. Well...I see...well thank God. Well done Stephen.  Nine? EXT. RIVER - DAY unfolds. The TWO CREWS are from the same CLUB. in PETE, DAN, RAFF, BRIAN and finally the thin, boyish, STEPHEN, in the role of COX, facing the rowers, calling out the stroke-rate using a coxswain's loud-hailer.

PUB ON RIVER - DAY Rowdy tables of graduates and undergraduates and rowers, males and females. Beer flows. Playing PINBALL are BRIAN, REES, ELLIS and CARTER. STEPHEN watches, drinking a beer, distracted. No, no, listen, listen, pay attention. A man enters a lift, wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th. Why?  Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift. Collective groan. BRIAN is clipped around the ears. Hey--it's the closest I'll get to a unifying theory, leave me alone. himself, finally notices STEPHEN, bursting to provide the answer. BRIAN acts to SILENCE STEPHEN -  Uh!!! No--we give up. No idea. He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor. Okay, I've got one. Okay, okay-- A naked girl enters a lift -  CONTINUED: STEPHEN, at the bar, opens JANE's NAPKIN. Looks at the number.  Do you have change for the pay- phone? Sure. The BARMAN takes STEPHEN's POUND and glances at the NAPKIN. I'd commit that number to memory if I were you. Reflected - a WOMAN who looks like JANE. Is he imagining this? disappear in the glass of his glasses as she crosses the room. The BARMAN's voice is distant... Here you go... Sir? Are you okay? Uh - my napkin just walked in. them. As one YOUNG MAN pours them beers she hands her beer to someone else. And then - Hi. Girls and Jocks and stare straight at JANE. The others fall silent and stare at STEPHEN, but JANE's eyes light up. Hello. REACTION: DIANA: Not impressed.  CONTINUED:  What's the probability? Reasonably low.  Uh - this is - Stephen. He smiles at her. The OTHERS look back and forth between JANE and STEPHEN. JANE perks up, interested. Croquet. Do you play croquet?  Um. Not recently. Sunday morning? I'm actually busy Sunday mornings. Oh. Of course.  Him. disappointed - stares at him, as do the others. INT. CORRIDOR/DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND and knocks - INT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE/DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND Stephen, come in. Sit down. Now-- we're all rather concerned--about your choice of subject. What it's going to be. I can't decide. Any ideas? One of SCIAMA's PENS sits precariously on the edge of the desk, and in shuffling papers, knocks it off.  CONTINUED: The PEN rolls off the DESK and falls on the FLOOR in front of STEPHEN. STEPHEN stares at the PEN as it comes to a STOP. Umm-- No. drawer. Come with me. INT. CAVENDISH LAB, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron, where Rutherford split the atom. One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom. gives it to STEPHEN. Next Friday. I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London, to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose. Come along if you're interested.  Oh, and close the door as you leave. to the BLACKBOARD, picks up a piece of CHALK, looks at the begins to study, with RAPT AWE, the ancient LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. EXT. ANGLICAN CHURCH STEPS - DAY - the WILDES emerge, in the SUNDAY FINERY. JANE peels off from her family to talk to STEPHEN. She is pleased to see him. So I gather you've never been to church?  CONTINUED: Once upon a time. He smiles wryly at this Fairy Tale reference. Tempted to convert? He thinks about this. I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast. INT. DINING ROOM, HAWKING FAMILY HOME - DAY Sunday family lunch. A noisy, eccentric, bohemian atmosphere. STEPHEN's father, FRANK opens his HOME-MADE WINE. His sister PHILIPPA  passes the plates. MARY  reads a BOOK. And Jane? What are you studying? Arts. Languages, poetry. I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually. Oh? What in? The HAWKINGS, impressed, nod approvingly at STEPHEN.  Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula. stare blankly at JANE for a moment, before silently returning to setting the table. FRANK rescues the mood - Arts. So, what painters do you like? Well, I like--Turner... Really? Turner? To me they all look as if they've been left out in the rain.  CONTINUED: pours a glass of wine. And...William Blake. Good heavens. Surely not!  Will you try my elderflower wine? Yes, please.  Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane. Enter ISOBEL, STEPHEN's mother, with a ROAST CHICKEN. As FRANK passes wine, JANE looks nervously at STEPHEN, who smiles at her. FRANK picks up the CARVING KNIFE and starts to SHARPEN it. Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine. Philistine.  If you don't watch out I'll send you back with a couple of bottles. So Stephen, you've been to church with a good woman. Are you feeling holier than thou? Positively saintly, thank you.  You've never said why you don't believe in God. A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator. father seem pleased with it too. JANE notices -  CONTINUED:  Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists.  Light or dark?  Jane? Light meat or dark? Er - light, please. I'll wing it. As usual. The old family PUNNING game has begun. Boooo. How plucky of you. Ohh, fowl play! Fowl play. Stop egging him on! It's so nicely cocked. Hawking laughter. Ha! Ha! JANE is bemused.  Don't worry about them. They're pun mad. That's okay -  - the breast is yet to come. HA! Marvelous! Very good. "The breast is yet to come!" Indeed it is! Well done.

GONVILLE & CAIUS COLLEGE/ MAY BALL - NIGHT dance-floor, sipping PUNCH. The MAY BALL is now in full and magical swing, as couples float across the lawns before the great facade of the college. Should we dance, do you think? Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating. I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance?  CONTINUED: No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance. Just then - A BLUE UV LIGHT comes on. This causes great excitement on the dance-floor. All the other couples "ooh" and "ahh" and even more people take to the floor - not so,  Do you see how the men's cuffs and shirt-fronts, how they glow more than the dresses?  Yes... Do you know why? Why? "TIDE." The washing powder? The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light. Why do you know that?  When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little - eyes. - like that.  CONTINUED:  They watch, impressed, as - FIREWORKS are suddenly heard, EXT.

STEPHEN watches JANE, captivated by her happiness in this moment. C) A CHAMPAGNE TENT - JANE selects a FLUTE OF CHAMPAGNE and takes a BIG SIP, to the sound of a NEARBY 1920's CHICAGO JAZZ So why...  ...why... Why? Why medieval Spanish poetry?  I suppose I like to time travel. And what particular time periods do you visit? half of his into her glass. The Twenties is always fun. The roaring twenties! Cheers! They CLINK GLASSES and sip their champagne, laughing. So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it?  CONTINUED: "Seek then/ No learning/ from Starry Men!/ Who follow with Optic Glass/ The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass." Ouch. Was it - They move off across the NEARBY DANCE-FLOOR, and PASS the river under which LIGHTED PUNTS drift by. - was it a good time for science? A smashing time actually. Spacetime was born. Spacetime... Space and Time finally got together. People always thought they were too dissimilar, couldn't possibly work out. But then along comes Einstein, the ultimate match- maker, and decided that space and time, not only had a future, but had been married all along. The perfect couple! They arrive at the FOOT-BRIDGE, with its view of the BRIDGE D) FOOT-BRIDGE. looks up at the STARS, bright, sparkling. JANE does the same. Well that's astonishing, isn't it? Silence, then -  CONTINUED:   "In the beginning was the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and darkness-- darkness was upon the face of the deep." STEPHEN, moved, looks at her. Would you dance with me? He takes her hand and starts to DANCE with her to the music, and then tilts his head and KISSES her. FOOTBRIDGE, the punts floating underneath, the night magical, the lovely slow jazz drifting over the scene. EXT. FRONT DOOR / WILDE FAMILY HOUSE - DAY opens the door to get the MILK. Looks down. PAN down to - a for STEPHEN - smiles, delighted - IN LOVE. EXT. PLATFORM, CAMBRIDGE TRAIN STATION - DAY the platform. The train is already pulling in. SCIAMA, and the OTHER THREE all run for it.

KING'S COLLEGE CLASSROOM -   LONDON - DAY before a small audience in a small room. The blackboard is crammed with calculations and diagrams. So what do we know? Let me rephrase that--what do the equations tell us, finally?  CONTINUED: He turns the blackboard over. A blank board. How about a simple diagram? Smiles, small laughter from the audience. STEPHEN looks especially relieved. A star, more than three times the size of our sun... He draws a circle on the board. ...ought to end its life, how? With a collapse, the gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms, and so collapsing inwards. If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse, creating a black hole - where the warping of spacetime is so great that nothing can escape... not even light. It gets... He draws a smaller circle, inside the first. Smaller, smaller... An even smaller circle. The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? He draws a point. A point. A spacetime singularity... With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working.   CONTINUED:  What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now! INT. MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT As his friends talk excitedly, STEPHEN is silently staring down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him, into which he pours CREAM... SLOWLY, CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY. As he stares, deep in thought, the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses with LIGHT - he is having an epiphany here - a major insight... ...and then TIME GOES INTO REVERSE. As it does so, the CREAM more returning to its original central dollop, and then vanishing. The coffee creamless. STEPHEN looks up...  I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen-- Sensing his protege is on to something, perhaps even a small smile. Go on. If? If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe? EXT. RIVERBANK, CAMBRIDGE - SUNSET  CONTINUED: If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? - - Alright - - which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... What are you doing? Winding back the clock!  Is that what you're doing? That's what I'm doing. Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... They SPIN faster and faster until they almost trip and only save themselves by clasping each other closely...  ...until you get - INT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE/DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - DAY A singularity.  CONTINUED: A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time. The universe born from a black hole exploding.  Keep going. Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began? Keep going. Develop the mathematics. I don't know how. and hands it to him. INT. RUTHERFORD LAB LECTURE HALL He stops, thinks, continues, then deletes a bit, and writes again, faster, faster, his mind racing, even as his fingers begin to betray him, growing weaker, weaker... EXT. TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY The swirl of CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY life. Dons on bicycles. Purposeful students. Every building looking like a STATELY HOME. FINGERS, across campus but then suddenly, trips - FALLS - falls hard. His head smashing onto the hard paving stones. His GLASSES fly off his face. He is unconscious immediately. MONTAGE: A) X-RAY DEPARTMENT. STEPHEN, his face GRAZED and BRUISED, lies on a tilting bed as X-rays are taken.  CONTINUED: B) Blood is taken from his arm. C) In a PUBLIC WARD, STEPHEN, sitting on the edge of a bed in a HOSPITAL SMOCK, turns and looks at a SICK YOUNG MAN in the next bed, who looks GRAVELY ILL. D) Dexterity Test - Stephen struggles to bring his little finger to meet his thumb. Stephen, lying down, as the doctor violently jerks his knee up. Stephen lying prone in foetal postion as a doctor performs a lumbar puncture and extracts fluid from his spine. What is it? What's wrong with me? E) STEPHEN lies in the PUBLIC WARD while the SICK YOUNG MAN in the next bed is discovered DEAD. Nurses rush the SICK F) INT. WARD/ HOSPITAL - DAY The DOCTOR is dismissive and unsentimental. It's called motor neuron disease. What's that? The DOCTOR, despite his unsentimental nature, draws a deep breath. This is not the speech he wants to make... It's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity such as speaking, walking--breathing-- swallowing. The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted, cut off. The result is--gradual muscle decay, a wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control voluntary movement is--lost--entirely. EXERCISE, stretching - walking. Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--? Improvement should not be expected.   CONTINUED:  I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years. There's nothing I can do for you, I'm terribly sorry. Silence. The SENIOR DOCTOR rises to go - Wait! What about--what about the brain? The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change--it's just- What? Eventually--no-one will know what they are.  Ever so sorry. The DOCTOR walks away. REACTION: STEPHEN, devastated. Frozen. People walk past him and he doesn't move, doesn't react. INT.

"Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage..." Silence. BRIAN waits for STEPHEN to speak. So? What did they say? Your wrist. What did they say? I have a disease, Bri.  Is it--venereal, Stephen? No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player. Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub.  I have two years to live.  Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud. What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous!   CONTINUED: You were fine a couple of days ago.  Steve? You're fine. What did they say...? Will you leave me Brian? I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so... The BEDDER knocks and enters. Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl. Right. OK.

I understand you saw him. You know he was in hospital... INT. COMBINATION ROOM/TRINITY HALL/CAMBRIDGE - DAY watching TV in the common room. At a distance, JANE stops, shocked. He looks woebegone, depressed, physically reduced already. She summons up a cheerful demeanor, however, and advances. Something educational?  Very.   CONTINUED: John is having an affair with Martha. But Martha is in love with Alan. And I think Alan is homosexual by the look of his shirts. I'm trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness. Are you close? It's some integer of zero, but I'm not there yet. STEPHEN? You just missed him. He was here earlier. Don't do this. What? Cut me off. Go. Teach me croquet.  Come on. Teach me.  What is this? I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it..."a slough of despond." If you don't get up and play a game with me I won't come back here again. Ever. Silence. He finally looks at her.

With his second shot he hits her BALL. He then picks up his BALL, places it beside hers so that it touches, puts his foot on his ball, then smacks his BALL HARD with his MALLET, blasting her ball down to the next hoop. He proceeds to play a MASTER GAME that will not allow JANE another shot, enlisting her ball to advance his own from HOOP to HOOP, until - - he knocks his ball and hits the finishing peg. TEARS, until she can bear it no longer, and walks up to him and picks up his ball, stopping the game.

So - if you care about me at all - go. interchange - almost trapping STEPHEN, who is gallantly trying to resist being taken into her life. I can't. I've got two years. I need to work. I can't. His eyes widen. He can't believe his ears. He looks at her. I think--I've fallen in love with you. He can't speak now. This STUNS him. I know. Strange. Inexplicable. You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion... My chances are probably -  - well, some "integer of zero", but I think we can make a go of this. I want us to be together, for as long as we've got. And if that's not very long then - well, that's just how it is. It will have to do. You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything.  CONTINUED:  She advances, and kisses him on the lips. He is still speechless. She stares into his eyes, with love -- Your glasses are always dirty. She takes them off, cleans them on her dress. His heart is exploding with joy and hope.

Stephen probably averaged, what was it?--an hour a day your entire university career?  Unbelievable levels of sloth! As the conversation turns into a HUBBUB of chatter, STEPHEN, smiling, drops his FORK. JANE, in conversation now with one of the GIRLFRIENDS, picks up the fork without barely looking at STEPHEN and put it back in front of him. wonderfully, effortlessly      dextrous. FRUSTRATED, ENVIOUS, and saddened, STEPHEN watches      closely then, before emotion breaks through, rises, grabs his      TWO WALKING STICKS and starts to leave.  Stephen? I'm sorry.

Stony, sceptical faces greet this outrageous idea. As STEPHEN continues his speech, ANGLE ON SCIAMA and TAYLOR.  He's unifying Relativity--plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. For the first time.  CONTINUED:  Thermodynamics? Last used to describe the steam engine. During this exchange  STEPHEN has been saying: In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So... SCENE: INT. PUB ON RIVER, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT No,no!

Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No - no God? Really?  Fascinating. Because I'd understood you'd proven the need for a Creator. My mistake. No. Mine.  Yours. Your mistake? that this matter is a CAUSE OF DIVISION between JANE and STEPHEN.) Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die. Why must God die? I don't see. then picks up a SECOND FORK and spears a LARGE BOILED  CONTINUED:  The two great pillars of physics  - Quantum Theory, the laws that govern the very small--electrons, particles so on--and General Relativity... Oh, yes - Einstein. ...Einstein's theory.  Which governs the very large, planets and such--but Quantum -   Relativity... They're--different? They don't remotely play by the same rules. Peas are chaotic, and don't behave predictably at all - With her 'pea' fork she stirs some more peas on her plate - creates 'chaos'. UNLIKE--POTATOES - Which you can set your watch by.  Very good. Even STEPHEN has begun to begrudgingly enjoy this, even as he starts COUGHING. FOLLOWING: If the world were all potatoes, easy--you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did, a moment of Creation. Hallelujah, God lives.   CONTINUED:  But if you want to incorporate peas into the menu, which Stephen now wants to do, then it all goes - Tits up. Tits up. Haywire. Becomes a Godless mess. Oh, dear. Einstein hated peas, Quantum Theory. "God doesn't play dice with the universe", he said. Seems he not only plays dice - Seems he not only plays dice - - he throws them - where we can't find them.  - he throws them - - where we can't find them. How inconvenient! Stephen's swapped his telescope  - for a microscope.  Order for chaos--hoping to find a law to cover both. JONATHAN, impressed, looks at STEPHEN. Looking for "the world in a grain of sand." God is back on the endangered species list.  CONTINUED:  I expect he'll cope. But physics--is back in business. Physics is back in business. Stephen thinks it a fair exchange.  It's the final--challenge. We'll know everything. The final challenge? STEPHEN) More wine? couple. No, thank you.  We'll know everything. EXT. GARDEN/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT Under a STARRY sky - JONATHAN helps STEPHEN sip his coffee. It was leukaemia. Coming up on a year ago. She fought it, I nursed her, but in the end... Music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. I've struggled with loneliness, of course. Tyranny of the empty room, all that. Music is a consolation, although my career...

We have help. You know what I'm talking about.  CONTINUED:  Can't afford--live-in nurse. You can't afford to--  There must be a way. You need to find a way. For your family's sake. You're world famous - For black holes--not rock concerts. I believe it's urgent. INT. KITCHEN/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY You know very well what I'm talking about. No. I don't. We do have a right to know. We have a right to know, Jane. Know what?! Whose child Timothy is. Stephen's, or Jonathan's? JANE, turning, wheeling on ISOBEL, shocked. That's what you think of me?

If we try to bring him round from the anaesthetic it is not sure he will survive resuscitation. Stephen must live! You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic! Are you sure this is what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy, a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat. He will never speak again.

It's a heart-breaking moment-- for both of them--and when falling. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY FRAME, when - She's here. Okay. Promise not to eat her alive... Enter: ELAINE MASON. She is attractive. Exit: JANE, touching ELAINE supportively on the shoulder. So then - Professor. How are you? My name is Elaine. I'm going to be your nurse, would you like that? No? Well- we'll work it out. He stares at her, as - - ELAINE goes and gets a CHAIR, taking an interest in her, - ELAINE turns and catches him look at her. Swiftly, STEPHEN turns his eyes back to the NEWSPAPER. ELAINE looks at him a moment longer, surprises to see that STEPHEN is not unlike any other man in this regard. A faint smile appears. She sits in front of him. So then... INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY looks up at STEPHEN - sees through the clear perspex immediately what group he is looking at. She doesn't have to call out the colours - knows them. through the board so we establish the eye-line principle.) She is BRILLIANT at this. STEPHEN's eyes FLICK from GROUP to GROUP, no BLINKING going on.  Red group--Yellow letter. T. Green group--Black letter. E. Green-- Green. A....T.E.A. Tea.  You're good. You want tea. What type of tea?  CONTINUED: They look at each other. And then she has an IDEA. She PUTS You've memorised the board. Of course you have. What kind of tea? Blink when I say the group that has the letter you want. Green, Yellow, Blue, White, Black, Red...  I haven't got all day. Green-  Green group. And the letter in that group? You know their colours, I know you do. Green, Yellow - He BLINKS. She has MEMORISED the BOARD too - Yellow? Green,yellow--that's B. A breakthrough. They are both EXPERT. A tea beginning with B? Builder's tea! Right? He GRINS. She SMILES. She goes to get him some TEA. INT. HALLWAY/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY ELAINE, smiling, enters hall  and bumps into JANE, who has just arrived home with GROCERIES. They stop in front of each other.  I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky. Thank you. You must worship the ground beneath - wheels. And he's the perfect patient. Looking after him is so much easier than other patients I've had.   CONTINUED: And sooo funny, oh my God. When you read about him people don't tell  You only do two shifts a week, Elaine. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY WHEELCHAIR. JANE watches. Almost there! How does it work? A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software. Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one. Using this technique, the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute.  Better than one a minute. What I've done is--use components from a telephone answering system actually-- to convert the written text into synthesized speech. The voice sounds a bit robotic, but...  Okay. Shall we give it a try? There we go.  Welcome to the future!  CONTINUED: The TECHNICIAN sets a pressure-sensitive 'clicker' in STEPHEN's hand. The SCREEN suddenly floods with COMPUTER CODE. REFLECTED in the glass is the WIDE-EYED FACE OF STEPHEN. The TECHNICIAN demonstrates - builds a sentence for STEPHEN, selecting one LETTER at a time. STEPHEN is all concentration, observing how it is done. All set. Then you just click 'PLAY', like this - months. strong American accent) My--name--is--Stee--ven--Hawking. It's American! Oh, my Goodness.  Are there any other voices? That's all they have at the moment. Is that a problem? I think it's great! INT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT In a quiet moment, STEPHEN sits alone, trying out the new device. His face shows SADNESS, BLEAKNESS. His eyes move back to the COMPUTER SCREEN. His fingers CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the monitor. And finally we hear - his sadly moving homage "2001: A Space Odyssey"). Daisy. Daisy.  Give Me Your Answer Do. Finally - he SMILES. He has cheered himself up. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY Through the OPEN DOORS into the LIVING ROOM we hear TIMOTHY squealing with joyous delight, then see him run out - As TIM passes out of shot we hear then see STEPHEN slowly motor out of the LIVING ROOM, chasing him, with - - a LARGE BROWN PAPER GROCERY BAG OVER HIS HEAD voice-synthesizer loudly proclaims the DALEK war-cry from Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD /CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT eyes turn to her as she hears: I will write. A Book. At four words a minute? About what? TIME. Time... She smiles at him. MONTAGE: A) The HANDS ON A CLOCK turn very quickly, TIME running fast. B) STEPHEN motors down the cloisters of his college.  CONTINUED: What is the nature of Time? C) His PALSIED RIGHT HAND clicks the CLICKER, as he works at home at night. Will it ever come to an end? D)   A PRINTER prints out the text we hear in V/O - Can we go back in time? E) He works in office at DAMPTP. Some day these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun, or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. He SMILES. F)   He motors by the college at sunset. Only Time, whatever that may be, will tell. INT. DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT CLICK, CLICk...  Professor? smiling, is starting to UNWRAP. He urgently types a voice message - click, click, click - but he isn't fast enough - she has opened it. Too late he clicks "PLAY" - It is for a friend. 'Course it is. That's what they all say.  CONTINUED: She surprises him by crossing the room and opening the PAGES of the MAGAZINE for him. You don't have to be embarrassed around me, Professor. I know what men are like. SURPRISED, STEPHEN finds himself with the PENTHOUSE open before him. He looks at the MAGAZINE, then at ELAINE, then at the MAGAZINE. Just then - office DOOR OPENS.      Enter, SCIAMA. He stops when he sees the MAGAZINE. Oh. I'm sorry. He exits, blushing. STEPHEN grins. ELAINE bursts out laughing. Next one? He SMILES at her - falling in love with her. She detects this, happily. What? INT. WEST ROAD FLAT/ CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT STEPHEN, alone, continues to write, one painstaking word at a time. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY JANE, exhausted, rubbing her eyes as she PROOF-READS STEPHEN's text, like the old days. She pauses, looks up, into the next room, at - - ELAINE laughing at something the grinning STEPHEN has said. INT. DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - DAY He ponders this. Then has an idea. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. He inserts "BRIEF" into the title. He stares at the screen. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY TIME." While reading the LAST PAGE manuscript for his book, JANE stops and is stunned by something she reads. She rises, and rushes - with the LAST PAGE - into the next room where - INT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE   - DAY LIKE, hangs on the wall. So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe. I finally found her. Beside the PHOTO, ELAINE finishes SHAVING STEPHEN - then steps away to pick up some HAND LOTION. She inadvertently show him some LEG. STEPHEN notices. lovingly, into his HAND. JANE announce her presence. Elaine? Can we - ? Would you mind if I spoke with Stephen alone for a moment? We're not quite finished--can you come back in ten minutes? INT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY is 'typing' a message.  "Who are we? Why are we here? If we ever learn this, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason, for then we would know the mind of God."  'GOD'? Do you really mean this?  CONTINUED: Yes.  Of course. So you're acknowledging him? But as he continues to CLICK, feverishly, she excitedly exits, before he can add another word. He tries to generate the next word before she disappears but he is alone again by the time his computer belatedly spits out - He sags, frustrated that he was not fast enough to set her straight - but then she comes back in - Did you just say something? So you're actually going to let me have this moment. You - are - welcome. She smiles. She kisses him on the cheek, and then as she starts to leave - - on his SCREEN - STEPHEN selects the message he was writing earlier...clicks "PLAY." We hear - E-laine has offered to travel with me to A-merica. She will look after me.  Will she? Don't worry. He clicks "STOP". She nods, sadly. He smiles, sweetly. Both accept what is happening, but sadly.  CONTINUED:  America?  You always used to tell me when an invitation came in.  A-nother a-ward. What can you do? Everything will be okay. She tries to smile. How many years? screen and her. They said - two. We've had so many. The look in his eyes is his eloquent reply. Emotion overcomes JANE. Can this really be how it ends? It's so sad and bizarre and they both realise it in this moment. She tries to hide her tears by walking away from him and turning her back, hiding her face. this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward her. He stops just behind her, then nudges her leg, ever so gently, with his own lifeless foot, the way a pony will nudge its familiar rider. He clicks "PLAY" - Be. Happy. She turns back, CROUCHES, comes down to his level - right in front of him, eye to eye - I have loved you.  I did my best.  CONTINUED:  As TEARS form in his own eyes, he BLINKS ONCE at her - the only form of communication that feels right in that moment, and she understands all that it means. She smiles through her tears as she SMOOTHS HIS HAIR. Finally - words are not needed. INT. WEST ROAD FLAT - DAY from the SIDEBOARD, as - JANE watches, hiding her emotions. EXT. BOOKSHOP - DAY The window is dominated by a single display for STEPHEN's book - A Brief History Of Time. INT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY WIDE. JANE and her MOTHER, BERYL, at the dining table, the Remarkable. How is he? He wants to marry her. Don't blame yourself. We're proud of you. I'm trying hard not to think of this as a failure. But it wasn't a failure. But it feels like it! It feels like it, Mum.  Was it inevitable?  CONTINUED: Perhaps too many people were drawn in?  What will Stephen do next?  He's gone back to looking for his Theory Of Everything, his single equation. Well, it'll have to explain human relationships too. It's going to have to be a wonderful piece of mathematics.  All the accidents... All the unexpected forces... attractions...  A attracts B -- And vice versa. Of course. Then add Time - Adversity - Yes. Adversity over time -- - until the situation becomes unstable, heats up. Bang! And the whole thing starts over. Whole new galaxies.  CONTINUED:  Darling, I think we've cracked it. Shall we phone the Nobel committee now or shall we have another cup of tea first? JANE, wipes her eyes, smiles sadly. EXT. CHURCH - DAY The CHURCH in winter - a dusting of snow on everything. To the sound of ORGAN, SINGING CHOIR and CONGREGATION, the front doors open, and the VICAR appears to shake the hands of the first departing church-goers. INT. CHURCH - DAY The SERVICE is over. The congregation departs, revealing - - JANE in her seat, still reading a prayer book, as - - JONATHAN walks up the nave, toward her, chatting with the departing CHORISTERS. It seems that he hasn't noticed JANE and he passes close by, seemingly without seeing her. She averts her eyes. Then suddenly she feels a HAND brush her shoulder. When she turns to look, JONATHAN has walked past, and is still avidly talking to the CHORISTERS, heading for the main doors. JANE, with a beating heart, turns forward again and hears - - the FRONT DOORS of the church close. She is alone. She starts to cry in the empty church - thinking she has lost him forever, but then -- -- she hears SOFT PIANO MUSIC. She turns. Yes, music is coming from above. She rises, and moves toward the sound. INT. FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY  grows louder, louder, until - - with a pounding heart, she discovers JONATHAN, at the piano, gently playing his beloved Bach. Only eventually does he raise his eyes and smile at her, a smile which expresses his hope that she would come to him. She smiles back, her heart ready to burst. _____________________________________________________________ INT. HALLWAY/COCKCROFT LECTURE ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY       STEPHEN, accompanied by ELAINE, motors down the HALLWAY/LOBBY - FANS and PRESS, waiting at the DOORWAY to the AUDITORIUM. Some FANS, autograph hunters, hold copies of "BRIEF HISTORY" for STEPHEN to sign. Others just want to take PHOTOS. The general impression? STEPHEN is now a ROCK STAR. After a MALE FAN gets his PHOTO taken with STEPHEN - a FEMALE "BRIEF HISTORY") holds out a PEN to STEPHEN... Professor? Could you please sign a copy for me? ELAINE, gestures for STEPHEN to give his standard reply. He mouse-clicks once. I cannot sign copies of my book-- but if you like--I could drive over it. The FANS all laugh and all say "YES,YES,YES!" INT. COCKCROFT LECTURE ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY of the word: "TIME." WIDE: A packed lecture hall. Thankyou. I first met--the Professor--was it really 1963? Time- -where does it go? Back then, he was kind of annoying.  He knew things that his woeful work ethic should not have allowed him to know.    CONTINUED: But it's been--really--one of the great joys of my life to watch this man defy every expectation, both scientific and personal. So it's with no small pride that I ask him to return to the stage once more, to continue to do what he has always done - answer your questions. My most irritating student, my esteemed colleague, my good friend--Professor Hawking. As STEPHEN motors onto the stage, to applause - The first pre-selected question, please!  How have you been able to deal with all the physical challenges you face? reply. It's as if STEPHEN wishes to speak with his own voice, and is struggling to do so. In failure his eyes turn sadly to his screen, and then clicks the pad in his hand. Can you hear me?  There are some things I cannot do. But. They are mostly the things I don't particularly want to do anyway. Now you are recognized everywhere, how do you deal with all the attention? I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking. Laughter. He believed me.  CONTINUED:  Even bigger LAUGH. APPLAUSE. In 1979 you talked about the possibility of a theory of everything being discovered before the end of the century. I now predict -- that I was wrong. LAUGHTER. Is Time Travel possible? LAUGHTER. I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came. LAUGHTER. As GUEST 5 rises and starts to speak, the volume goes down on this question... Professor Hawking, you have said you don't believe in God... the CAP of a YOUNG LADY's PEN falls off the front lecture bench and drops to the floor.... STEPHEN stares at the fallen CAP. that fallen CAP...Miraculously, the muscles in his slackened face start to stir...slowly his distorted expression straightens...his slumped head stirs and moves...his fingers stir...his feet ...his legs...he slowly, slowly straightens in his wheelchair, and not only this...he even begins to rise painfully out of it, at last standing on his own... Standing, he crosses the floor, picks up the fallen CAP, and holds it out the pretty YOUNG LADY. She smiles at him, not at all astonished!  CONTINUED:  You have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you? the scene, heart-breakingly unable to do what he wishes. It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies... AUDIENCE, being greatly stirred by the following words - ...but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope. APPLAUSE, STANDING OVATION. Smiles. INT.

They finally SMILE tenderly, and then - Your glasses are always dirty. STEPHEN'S POV as - his glasses are removed from his nose by JANE, cleaned, and then replaced on his nose.

QUEEN'S PRIVATE GARDEN,BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY In the garden, the HAWKING children play as freely as in their own, while STEPHEN is lifted to the bottom of a set of steps by two EQUERRIES.  CONTINUED: Left unattended, he motors forward a short distance and stops to watch his children. Fulfillment floods into his expression. A moment of deep satisfaction. He then looks around for JANE, finally making his CHAIR turn around. He sees her - some distance away. She has detained one of the EQUERRIES.  I'll leave a card. There's a number you can call.

She KISSES him on the cheek. Thank you. For today. It's been extraordinary. It's all just been rather extraordinary though, hasn't it?
