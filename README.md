- detailes in the power point presentation (Movie Scripts.pptx) and word document report (Analysis of Movie Scripts.docx)

## Motivation
We wanted to look at movie scripts and see if there were any common traits associated with movies. Because of this we decided to do text mining on Movie Scripts and analyze text features. 

## Executive summary
By looking at movie scripts we have found a number of interesting conclusions based on what we found. We found that one of the largest emotions that are found in movies is trust. We also found that common genre movies do tend to cluster around each other like for example kids’ movies. We expected there would be more clustering around genre but, it wasn’t as significant as we expected. 

## Methods:
- Clustering (hclust and kmeans)
- Association Rules
- Sentiment Analysis 
- Frequency Plots
