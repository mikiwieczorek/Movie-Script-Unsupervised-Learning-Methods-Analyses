Papa and Nindam, as cornermen, go to work...but Billy's zapped his energy. As Billy inhales several sharp breaths, a strange RINGING fades in OVER the following... -- GAMBLERS' hands signals, the odds rising; -- MAMA watching, concerned; -- PAPA and NINDAM shouting instructions to Billy, but he/we can't hear them, only this shrill RINGING... -- ECKACHAI gets off his stool, revived and ready; 5. storms out, tries to put Eckachai away -- Billy SWINGS HEAVILY, THUNDERING HAYMAKERS THAT MISS and MISS -- Nindam, screaming encouragement in Thai as -- Eckachai AVOIDS, then SLAMS an elbow into Billy's eye, jarring and concussive -- Billy staggers, blinking, dazed...

All of it, a disaster. as the RAGE...becomes REMORSE...becomes SELF-HATRED...and PAIN. as he walks the crowded streets. Face bruised, blood dried through a bandage above his eye... 6. From Billy's DRUGGED POV, IMAGES are kinetic and abstract, a nightmarish KALEIDOSCOPE: Flashing lights.   Psychoactive.   Multicolored. Shadows pass/undulate. Stray dogs everywhere... People talking, laughing, shouting... Billy moves through it, focus jumping, blurring. Everything pulsing, pounding, claustrophobic. Music assaults us. Bass so heavy, it jars our teeth. We're in a seedy sex playground, under harsh neon lights. Strippers on stage, on poles, in cages...Most of them high on drugs, empty eyes, bored. "Coyote Girls" in string bikinis, servicing tourists, all sweating like fiends... slams a double-shot of whiskey. He turns and scans the crowd till he spots a young Thai girl...NINA, 20's, bikini clad...giving a lap dance to a mid- 60's CUSTOMER. To Billy, Nina is impossibly beautiful, an angel, a rose. His anger builds, as the Customer paws Nina's breasts and legs. Nina looks up from her Customer, and sees Billy watching her. Eyes meet...Billy forces a smile...Nina nods to a booth where two YOUNG AUSTRALIAN MEN  nervously wait. Billy slams another whiskey, then-- are in a stall. The Australians stare at Billy's bruises and bloodied bandage...as he counts out two packets of 100 Yaba, wrapped in cling film. Australians hand Billy cash. Billy counts, pockets it. Gives them the pills. Then Australians #1/#2 watch as Billy cooks up a hit of Yaba. Foil -- lighter -- smoke -- suck... a 7. works the club... ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Billy hustling deals...Yaba for cash, deal after deal. Getting HIGHER with customers. Getting The music gets LOUDER. The action HEAVIER. More NARCOTIC... A very intoxicated Billy throws water on his face. He shadow- boxes a few punches in front of a filthy mirror...then stares at his reflection, morosely. looks around for Nina. He finds her in a corner chatting with other girls. THE MUSIC DEAFENING NOW -- We cannot hear what's being said as... Billy heads over. Nina sees his condition and stands up. Billy tries to talk to her. Nina rejects him. Billy takes her by the arm and pulls her close. Nina catches the desperate pain in Billy's eyes, and looks at him, gravely. Billy lets Nina go. She hurries off -- is obliterated, sweating profusely as he walks through the club...Only the hardest sex/drug addicts remain. Billy's legs buckle; he uses a wall for support, sparks a JOINT to slow his heart. His distorted POV.....A Stripper slides a cigar from her vagina and pumps out smoke rings. Men applaud, hurl cash on stage. Billy blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating. Billy dances, alone, trancelike. Releasing himself from himself. Everything rising to a fever pitch. Then, without warning... A STRANGE THUMPING begins, quietly, that carries us into.... 8. sits in a chair, nude, his back to us. Billy is, by now, paralytic. Mouth open, head tilted back, like a corpse...The strange and dull THUMPING builds, like a muted heart beat... boom... boom... boom... Billy mumbles, incoherent. Eyes rolled back, the drugs cocooning him in a blissful isolation from all else. The thumping, louder now... Boom... Boom... Boom... Billy's eyes start to flutter. Tries to open them: can't. Suddenly, loud/startling... BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! Billy snaps alert -- turns to the door. Someone's BANGING on it from the other side; THEN, LOUD VOICES BEGIN SHOUTING IN THAI... Billy peers through the peep-hole: SEES 4 THAI COPS, guns out. He spins, looks at his table -- It's full of EIGHT YABA PACKETS, burned matches, a pipe. He looks at his desk -- it's covered with WEAPONS: a Colt .45, machete, a stun gun, knuckle duster, a pile of cell phones/sim cards, and a Samurai sword. Fuck. Billy quickly grabs a few yaba packets and forces them up his ass -- painfully as -- While pulling on clothes, Billy takes a fall, gets up, as -- 9. NECK, ALL SHOUTING IN THAI -- #3 + #4 find TWIN SYRINGES in a pie tin on the stove. They immediately search for drugs: ripping open cabinets, rifling drawers, kicking out panels, trashing everything they touch... is dazed, his cut reopen, bleeds down his face and t-shirt as the Cops walk him downstairs in handcuffs... They slow for a moment, passing the reception desk...where the Billy looks away in shame. They force him outside to... ...a waiting POLICE PICKUP TRUCK. Billy is shoved in the back of the truck, like an animal. And as they drive away, the first streaks of dawn light the horizon over Bangkok... in back. A POLICE MOTORBIKE follows, headlight glaring bright. Billy watches as various BANGKOK STRATA goes past...Empty streets. Markets opening. Vendors and shops. The city waking, coming to life. Title:              A PRAYER BEFORE DAWN We slam in mid-scene. Billy -- sweating, nervous, hands cuffed behind his back, sitting in this room -- as five THAI All the weapons and phones from his apartment are spread across a desk, along with his passport...Billy is terrified, doesn't know what's being said. 10. You sign, na! I can't read Thai. SIGN! --SIGN!  AY?!  You steal, na. I bought those. Drug dealer. No. --Yaba: Death for you. No...fuck no. 11. First Officer glances -- Cop #1, lightening fast, yanks Billy to his feet. First Officer grabs the KNUCKLE DUSTER off the desk and SLAMS a vicious punch to Billy's sternum. Billy loses wind, vomit/pills tunneling up his throat -- He retches violently, gags it back; First Officer and Cops watching, waiting like vultures..... Billy slumps in his chair, trembling hard, about to puke. First Officer slides the confession + pen to Billy, closer... For the weapons and phones.  ...the Embassy...  They no help you. First Officer picks up the knuckle duster again; Billy signs. is shoved inside by Cops. The cell is small, dark and foul, filled with 30 or so other sweating bodies. Billy paces intensely, anxiety in his eyes. He waits for the Cops to vanish down a hall. THEN... ...Billy turns around and VOMITS. Yaba packets hit the floor, plastic burned by intestinal acid. Billy drops to his knees, anxiously digs through chunks and fluid to find the Yaba pills. A few others in the cell take notice: ADDICTS, sweating, scratching...They hungrily move toward him... Billy quickly starts to eat the pills. He looks up, sees the Addicts standing over him. Threatening tension hangs. Billy moves back. The Addicts swoop in, devouring the rest of his pills like wolves. 12. Billy watches, helpless. rides, crammed among PRISONERS. He's having acute withdrawals. Sweat soaked, in a lot of pain. Even sunlight hurts. Gates open, revealing the compound...High concrete walls and barbed electric fences. Looming guard towers at intervals. The bus lurches forward, rumbling through the gates...GUARDS approach with SHOTGUNS and CATTLE PRODS. The door jerks open: prisoners disembark, all in CHAINS, Billy among them... He gazes around, swallowed by the prison. are herded in. It's dim, narrow. Guards unlock the shackles; chains drop, rattling to the floor...Guards bark orders in Thai and the prisoners shed their clothes, lining up for cursory exams -- mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass... Billy watches, repulsed, as a SKINNY GUARD wearing a latex glove, uses the same finger for each exam, without sterilizing. Suddenly a muffled THAI RING-TONE plays from somewhere. It RINGS, RINGS and RINGS... Guards look around. Prisoners/Billy are still. NO ONE MOVES. The ring-tone keep playing. Then, Skinny Guard looks at a naked Thai  and orders him to step forward. He squats, coughs...and a CELL PHONE drops out. The name of the incoming caller: "Mom"  Cued by Skinny Guard's look, a BULL GUARD lashes out, BATON across Nok's jaw, splaying it open. He goes down in a heap, gash gushing red, defenseless. Billy stares in shock as Bull Guard hails a series of blows, baton beating Nok hard...The room goes DEAD SILENT. Bull Guard walks away, leaving Nok a motionless pulp... Skinny Guard says something in Thai...Billy steps up. Mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass -- demeaning. 13. #1 extracts a SWITCHBLADE and cuts Billy's pants into shorts. is seated on the floor...He's dopesick, scared, and looks it. Other Thais sit with him, cross-legged, not looking up. NOW: OFFICER PI SIT steps in, lowering his head to get thru the door. Chief of guards. 50, large, imposing. Without a doubt, the man in charge. He motions Billy to stand. Billy does, staring dead ahead, nervous, shaking...not meeting Officer Pi Sit's stare. Chi yeng yeng...  Officer Pi Sit taps Billy's chest lightly. And again: Chi yeng yeng...  I don't speak Thai. Officer Pi Sit takes a clipboard and pen from Guard #1.  Wi... Will-iam...William... William Moore.  Luck Sap.  BEAT. Age? Twenty-six. Faith? None.

Billy is fingerprinted. Billy is weighed on a scale. A visage rises up from behind it: Burmese, 30's, hawk-like features...Meet ELYIAS. Dressed in a clean blue-T/blue shorts, As he photos a sickly Billy, Elyias sees old track marks between Billy's scarred knuckles. Can make pain go `way... ... Me name Elyias. You sick, yes? Billy nods, in great pain... ...Elyias reaches into the seam of his shorts, pulls out a small object and discreetly slips it into Billy's hand: 50mg of white powder sealed in a 1/4 straw, burned at both ends. Heroin. Good medicine. Billy hesitates. Then he quickly bites the top off the straw, snorts the heroin, and -- A series of scenes. Billy high on heroin, as -- 1. Getting his scalp shaved by a prison barber. the blood from his face. 16. floor. Billy stirs his soup: A raw chicken head rises. is taken by GUARD #2 through corridors that twist and turn. A series of STEEL GATES and BARRED DOORS are unlocked and locked again as they pass. The feeling is endless, unsettling. They finally arrive at -- It's jam packed with over 70 THAI PRISONERS on threadbare blankets, inches apart...Their clothes tattered, some with blood-stained bandages, some in shackles. The chattering is loud, incessant. Stench, unbearable. Flies and mosquitoes ...Like a mass grave. Billy enters, nervous...The cell becomes VERY quiet. Guard #2 barks something in Thai and forces Billy along. He tries to keep a brave face as all the prisoners STARE at him... Seated on a blanket is TIFFANY, a Lady-boy in his 20's, long hair, unshaven, scabbed lips, fake tits, penis bulging under loosened shorts, and a t-shirt w/slogan: "NO MONEY, NO HONEY" Nearby: A BODY lies on a damp, stained mattress. Insects feed on open wounds. A shirt covers his face. Guard #2 points Billy to the hard cement floor, between Tiffany and the corpse. I'll sit somewhere else. Guard #2 shouts in Thai. No, somewhere else... hoping Guard #2 understands--) I'll sit over there. Guard #2 shouts louder now. --Are you off your fuckin' nut? He's dead. Guard #2 throws Billy down hard to the floor, walks away. 17.  No worry. Tomorrow he go. Many, many happy. Me name Tiffany. Relax. I no like farang. Cock too big.

Five hundred baht: Lady- Boy sew you blanket. Prison shop sell food. All inmate work for guards or other inmate to survive. No money? You die--  --like him. And a loud WHISTLE BLOWS. Sleep now, no more talk... Billy lies back, staring miserably up at the lights that will stay on all night...He then sees a SECURITY CAMERA pan/zoom onto him...Ceiling fans RATTLE and WHIR. Thousands of insects Billy shuts his eyes. cell, one cell after the next... Billy bolts awake, looks around, disoriented. It's morning; and prisoners sit in rows for head count. Each shout a number in Thai, Neung, Song, Sam, etc...It STOPS on Billy; Guard #1 looks up from his clipboard, SHOUTS THAI at Billy. Billy doesn't understand.   All eyes on him.  Farang, number you! 19. Six? In Thai! I don't know... Hok! Hok. Hok!! Hok!! Count resumes: others shout. Guard #1 writes it down. Billy watches as two TRUSTEES enter to remove the corpse, now black with rigor mortis. Billy quickly snatches the corpse's blanket, as they carry him away. Prisoners roll up their blankets. Billy does the same. a plastic barrel. Billy watches as other PRISONERS quickly grab large, plastic lemonade bottles from a pile in the corner and fill them up with water. Billy, still sitting there, hears someone giggle...He looks over to see a mentally retarded Thai inmate, filthy, in moldy flip-flops,  watching him...Laughing. Noi is the only other prisoner not trying to get water. Now, Billy gets up and hurries in to get water. It's rowdy, chaotic: NUMEROUS PRISONERS all yelling in Thai, forcing their way in to fill up their bottles. Billy gestures/talks. No one understands him. Billy finally manages to fill up three bottles for himself. in line among prisoners. Billy struggles to hold/carry his bottles of water. One is leaking. He tries to cover the hole. Two THAI PRISONERS in their underwear, leaving the troughs, bump into Billy...and he drops all his water. 20. Billy holds in his frustration...barely. and prisoners are fed breakfast. Rice and soup with only the head attached). Billy forces it down. in line, looking nauseous. He waits, and waits...It's finally his turn. He runs into the stall and vomits. walks down this long corridor alone, then heads out a door... ...into the chaos and cacophony of the MAIN YARD, a strange world overflowing with bodies: all selling, eating, thieving, drugging, betting, fighting and fucking. barber, laundry, food, crafts, flavored water on ice for sale. STATIC, THAI MUSIC drones over speakers... Some are in groups , gambling and hawking wares. Lady Boys on the prowl. A human piranha tank. Above it all, GUARDS watch from the two-story cell block and surrounding towers. Yoo-hoo, farang!  You want fuck arse me? The Unshaven Lady-Boy lifts up her top to show giant, fake breasts. Billy ignores. Billy notices a few Westerners together: Australian and Arab. They look at Billy...Billy stares them down. Then; BILLY'S POV -- across the yard...Amidst it all, he spots who he's been looking for: Elyias. 21. As Billy approaches...he sees Elyias with TRUSTEES #1 + #2 in a heated argument with THREE MUSLIMS. It's loud, threatening, lots of shoving, shouting in Thai. Billy stands back, watches. The Muslims storm away. Elyias turns...sees Billy, who discreetly gestures with his hands what he needs... follows Elyias through a gate, into the hangar-like structure. It's dim, red bulbs hang, row upon row of lockers. Elyias signals Billy to wait, then disappears into the shadows. alone. Nervous. Above him, Guards loom on balconies. They eye Billy, then move on...Billy waits and waits...It's intense and unnerving. Feels like forever. He decides to leave -- when Elyias suddenly returns with Trustees #1 + #2. Billy looks at them, ill at ease. Then, Elyias slips Billy a lighter, gum foil, and YABA PILL. As Trustees #1 + #2 stand watch, Billy lights up, cooks the drug. Thick smoke rises...Billy hard INHALES, and -- A FIST-FIGHT breaks out among prisoners. Then ANOTHER. Someone gets STOMPED. Other prisoners crowd around and gamble on who will win. is alone, motionless and drugged. WE SEE what/how HE SEES... The nude INDIAN PRISONER in the turban runs past, yelling, "I A BLIND PRISONER with a stick...An OLD MAN in a broken wheelchair...Another prisoner with NO LEGS on a wooden board with tiny wheels pulls himself along...A few PRISONERS being publicly punished, jogging in chains in the scorching heat... The Indian scurries onto a low divider laced with BARBED WIRE. GUARDS shout at him to get down. The Indian keeps moving/yelling "I HAVE GOD POWER," then jumps for the main wall -- hits the ELECTRIC FENCE -- instantly fried. "God Power" gone. 22. The Guards cut the Indian down. Billy just stares, over-fucking-whelmed. Then, a strange calm washes over him...as if feeling the Indian is now free. lies awake, depressed. Fluorescents blaze, humidity hangs. He looks around at the other prisoners, inches apart. BILLY'S POV: Some are asleep. Most in bad health: open sores, diseases. Tiffany snores beside him. One prisoner mumbles to himself, incoherent. Another cries quietly, his foot badly infected with gangrene. A third prisoner makes a crude weapon out of a SPOON. An OLDER PRISONER sits on the toilet steps, whistle around his neck, on suicide watch. He just stares at Billy, saying nothing... In the distance, faintly rising, we hear atonal CHANTING. The Islamic call to prayer. It drones, hypnotic, a hundred voices bypassing the prison walls... "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akba, Ash-hadu anla ilaha illah Allah," on and on. Billy rises, drapes a wet rag over his head, then moves to the bars and listens... do morning head-count for Guard #2. When the count reaches Billy, he yells "Nok!" and the count keeps going... sits on his blanket. Sweating, nauseous. Leg bouncing rapid. The itch to get high...Tries to fight it. He looks at the nail on his thumb. Starts to bite it. He begins to tear it off with his teeth. He rips it completely off and spits it on the floor. His thumb is torn and bleeding. Billy just stares at it. 23. He hears someone laughing. Billy looks over to see Noi, the mentally retarded inmate...laughing at him again. Then, Billy bursts out the door. sparks, a yaba pill boils...and Billy inhales full blast. Trustee's #1 + #2 keep watch. Then, Elyias: Yaba...Tiger. Horse. More you use, more you need... Billy, in some otherworldy place. The fuck are you on about? Now time, you pay me.  ...I'll pay when I can. Must pay now. No money, you pay other way... they/we see a distant GROUP OF MUSLIMS...CHANTING in Muslim prayer, using newspapers for prayer mats: "Allahu Akbar, Allahu, Aakbar..." Muslims. Bad for business... You, boxer-- Boom boom them. Elyias pounds a fist into his hand. I don't do that. Fuck off. Then me sell your debt to supplier: "the Samurai." Billy follows his gaze to a gang of SIX THAI in a nearby section of the yard. Predatory, junkie-thin, full tattooed. The leader, KENG, face tattooed, holds court. 24. HIV, AIDS, all them...  Syringes are swords. Buy drugs and you no pay? Give AIDS to you... Hidden by the rest, A YOUNG SAMURAI sits in the dirt...a full skeletal structure tattooed on his hands. He uses a strange, He looks at Billy. Eyes meet. Billy looks away. Choice yours. As Billy stands there, on the edge of a precipice.... busily work the stoves. Steam and flames rise in the dark as they cook. Malaysian music plays low on a RADIO. They talk in good spirits . THE OLDEST MUSLIM fills a large bowl with food and leaves to feed the others. laughs...Then, SOMEONE  turns the radio up, LOUD. The Muslims stop, turn... stands there. STARK STILL. A pain in his eyes: self hatred, remorse. Then, his rapid breathing induces a RAGE, RISING... The Muslims furrow their brows. A split-second heartbeat...just one; brutal it's hard to watch. Malaysian music blares, drowning out the Muslims' screams. Billy destroys them both...till the Muslims lie there, barely breathing, bloody, crippled pulps. are blood covered. He runs water in a sink, fills up a bucket, and sinks his hands into it. The water turns red. Billy stares at it. Silent and tense. lies awake, under a white sheet. Empty, sick, defeated. Nowhere to turn. Nothing to hope for. 25. One Prisoner on watch; everyone else asleep. pulled to his chin. He glances at Tiffany, asleep nearby. It's VERY TENSE, VERY QUIET... Prisoner on watch looks around. Then, Billy makes the tiniest flinch. And we see something dark -- moving... A SPOT OF BLOOD FORMS ON THE SHEET. THEN ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...ALL THEM POOLING OUT UNTIL THE SHEET Under the sheet: BILLY IS CUTTING HIMSELF WITH THE CRUDE Billy holds in tears; Suddenly, FEAR sets in. Instant REGRET and PANIC. Billy throws the sheet off...It's an horrific sight...His arms and leg and stomach opened and bleeding. Billy drops the spoon by the inmate he stole it from, waking and startling him. Nearby, Tiffany wakes up too, shocked as -- Billy staggers toward the bars...wounds pumping blood, air leaving him... Everyone begins chattering, incessant Thai; The prisoner on watch loudly blows his WHISTLE. Again and again. Billy grips the bars...Blood and drool and foam in his mouth, he sputters, no words... Hel-- Hel-- I, I need-- Billy, scared, lost-- rears up, SCREAMING--- HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!! BLACK. lies still and bandaged in a bed. Other patients in beds: AIDS-ridden, organs failing, runaway sepsis. One can't stop shaking. We're in Death's waiting room. Billy just lies there. Grave emotion. He quietly breaks down, ...then wipes the tears away. 26. is walked by two Guards past the ENTIRE INMATE POPULATION , gathered in the yard for head-count. All eyes on Billy. Humiliated. Officer Pi Sit watches from a distant balcony as the Guards lead Billy toward a tiny cell, built beneath the prison staircase -- And that is... No bed or   sink. Just a bucket for a toilet. Paint peels in scabs off   the ceiling, only three-feet high. Porno mag photos are stuck   to a wall, among dozens of markings from previous prisoners   counting down days. Billy grips the bars, on his knees, staring across the yard. Officer Pi Sit returns to his office. courtyard. Only a large BUDDHA STATUE remains; incense and candles burning, it's solemn face staring at Billy. Billy staring back. And as the sun starts to dip...In the distance, two GUARDS exit a cell, followed by a group of MEN...well built, full tattooed, shackled and chained...GYM BAGS in hand and BOXING past, not looking at Billy... Billy watches them go. Forlorn. Numb. Days have passed. Billy -- bearded, filthy -- and three THAI enter this huge, crowded cell, deemed maximum security. Guards slam the bars behind them. It's dark, foul. Wet clothes hang on lines. Bottles of murky fluids. It's a SAMURAI CELL. Wall-to-wall packed w/INMATES, tattooed from head-to-toe, many in shackles. Surveillance cameras...The air itself is dangerous. 27. Billy and the three Thai Inmates stand before the "cell boss," we saw in the yard: KENG. He sharply barks the rules in Thai. Billy's quiet, doesn't like the tone. A few Samurai laugh. As Billy looks for a space to sit, one Samurai gets up...KIAW . He shouts in Thai at a sleeping Samurai, "Bie!"  then kicks him hard in the ribs to make room for Billy. Then Kiaw looks at Billy and smiles... Okay, farang. You sleep here. Billy sits. I am Kiaw. Billy.  Me hear of you... Yeah, what'd you hear? That you crazy foreigner. Farang, ba. I like that. Kiaw friend to you... three Thai Inmates he came in with are clutching the cell bars as Samurai take turns kicking them from behind. Initiation...not for Westerner. When it's over, the three Thais celebrate. Samurai embrace them. Billy watches, feeling oddly rejected. wait in a long cue of prisoners leading up to the troughs. When it's their turn: five cups water, ten seconds soap, four cups water; Next prisoner's turn. 28. After, Billy and Kiaw shave, using dull razors and sharing a small plastic bowl of water. Kiaw gives Billy a clean t-shirt. Billy puts it on. linen sheets, clipped to lines, undulates in the breeze. Go behind it TO REVEAL: small clusters of junkie prisoners, using makeshift rigs out of Bic pens to boot heroin. watches, nervous and horrified as Kiaw builds a "syringe": taking apart a Bic pen, then using a lighter to burn/melt one end of the stem around a needle; As Kiaw breaks open a straw of heroin and mixes it with water in a bottle cap... Kiaw sucks the heroin mix up through the "syringe," then forces the needle into his vein, and blows the heroin in; Billy is shocked. Now you. Fuck that. Best high like this. Billy, ill at ease, contemplates, then.... ....we HEAR a distant chorus of SOUND, IN THE DISTANCE: rhythmic POUNDING, chains JANGLING, ropes WHIRRING... It gets Billy's attention...he's unsure what it is; as he starts thru the yard...He moves through the chaos, not saying a word... The SOUNDS get louder as we get closer, Billy following it... drawn to it, now arriving at... 29. Billy enters...Its cage enclosed, decrepit, yet full to bursting with MUAY THAI BOXERS at work: SKIPPING ROPES, of perpetual violence. A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper. BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything that's happened writ deep in his eyes. Everything he did wrong. All he'll never become. Wounded and frightened by the abundance of strength around him... The Boxers are aware of him now. They stop training. And Billy freezes. The Boxers staring at him. Every one of them, dangerous. Billy staring back. SCARY SILENCE. And just like that....  --I'm sorry...sorry, I didn't-- The Man  keeps shouting/driving Billy out -- Wait, I'm a fighter! I'M A FIGHTER!! A LIGHTENING FAST SHOVE and Billy's balance goes -- He falls completely out of the gym, lands on his back, on cement. Nan yanks the gate SHUT. Locks it with a SNAP. Billy looks at him, dumbstruck. Nan stares through the gate, smoking a cigarette. Then turns, disappearing into the gym. resume, and we CUT TO-- sits alone, head in hands, feeling sick. Other prisoners ignore him. 30. A Guard looms on a balcony. Billy wipes sweat, stands and gestures to him: I need a doctor. line up to a medical hatch, where TRUSTEE #3 hands out little cups of pills, with little cups of water. Other TRUSTEES mill. Billy, among the queue, ill, says to anyone in line -- What're they knocking out up there? In front of Billy, an enormous NIGERIAN INMATE answers -- Tramadol. Good for pain. Yeah? It's enough to do damage? Not like Dilaudid or Roxinol. But good enough.  I'm Billy Moore. What's your name? Black Dildo. "Black Dildo--?" Got a Christian name, haven't you? God name me this. I am Black Dildo. Well you know your painkillers, Black Dildo. How much they charging for it? Black Dildo regards Billy. He doesn't look well. Free to all. Help get prisoners clean. Billy nods; 31. Where's me pills? You pay. "Pay?" The hell you mean? It's free, isn't it? You, farang. Pay five pack cigarette. -- What?! Come back tomorrow. You no want trouble here. No, no. It's alright, Dildo. I got this... Now look, you lil' fuckin' cunt-- There's people waitin' here...I don't want no trouble, so play fuckin' nice and give me my pills. What'd he say? No pill for you! I NEED these pills-- 32. --He say you go now!  Three on one, shitbags! STOP! CALM DOWN! NO MORE! Okay! Alright, Dildo. I'm calm. I'm calmed down. Hey, farang. You no good boxer. Fight very bad. 33. Billy, ADRENALINE SURGE at the insult -- SCREAMS and breaks loose again, charging Trustee #6. The other Trustees knock Billy down with their batons and bury him. it slams open. Two TRUSTEES throw Billy on his face, like a sack of raw meat. Trustees go back inside... Billy rolls to his back, leaving a blood mask on the ground. Billy lies there...bloody and swollen. Eyes, purple slits. The sun beating down on him, flies nipping at him, barely able to breathe... Then, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches, blocking out the sun. Early 20's. A paige-boy hair cut. We see her in SILHOUETTE...  ...help me... The Woman gently dabs Billy's wounds with a wet rag, cleaning the blood. When she leans closer, her FACE comes into light. Her name is JOM. And she's a man...in bright red lipstick. You okay? Billy isn't. Face look very bad. Billy blinks. No worry now. Me name Jom. I help you. Jom sits Billy up, continuing to nurse him. After a moment, she helps Billy get to his feet. Billy holds onto Jom for support...step-by-painful-step, slowly making their way toward a looming ADMIN. BUILDING in the center of this fenced-in compound. Suddenly GUARDS #1 and #2 arrive, and shout at Jom in Thai. Jom shouts back. Arguing ensues. She's protecting Billy. 34. Guards roughly grab Jom and throw her aside. Billy collapses again. onto an iron cuff, around Billy's ankle. WIDEN. And Billy's leg is set on an anvil. A BLACKSMITH hammers a bolt through the clasp. Officer Pi Sit stands by with the Guards. Blacksmith hammers ANOTHER CUFF around Billy's ankle, then runs two ENORMOUS 6 KG CHAINS between shackles... Billy stands, bound, shackled...his swollen eyes, defiant. Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guards and Blacksmith to leave. Then, Officer Pi Sit exhales heavily, glares at Billy... Why are you so fucked up? Billy says nothing, inwardly tense. Disappoint me, William Moore. Fight like mad dog, no good. Must be same- same like Buddha. Billy is silent. Officer Pi Sit slowly circles him... You say you are "boxer."  Are you sayin' I'm not? Why you need drugs? Who said I "need" it? Pi Sit stops. Stares. Cold. Billy stands there. All his failures, like shrapnel, moving through his heart... 35.  -- I've got a lot of bad shit in me head...I don't want to think about.  When I use, I don't hear it. Pi Sit looks at Billy: sees the hard miles in his eyes. The pain in his voice. If you want fight, you should fight in the ring. But you must deserve it. Billy is silent; Behave, William Moore. Chi yeng yeng...and maybe real fighters can teach you something. ...I can't box with chains on... For three months, get used to it. waits alone, chained and shackled, seated against a wall. In the b.g., two LADY-BOYS  give massages to a pair of Guards on a shaded veranda of the Admin. buiding. Now, Jom approaches Billy... So you like fight? Billy is quiet, morose. -- Officer Pi Sit, good man. He protect us.  And now, he try and protect you... Billy is silent. He touches his lip: it still bleeds. Here, I feel safe. I go outside compound,-- danger!  36. Four thousand man want boom boom me...'cause I have pussy. Am real girl... A BEAT. Billy just stares at her, unsure what to say. I spend next thirty-five years of my life here...very much afraid.  I had boyfriend, say he love me. Then he lie and cheat, and I slit his throat when he beat me. Billy is silent.  Do you have girlfriend in prison? Just then, two Trustees arrive to escort Billy from the compound. He struggles to rise, chains rattling...glancing back once at Jom as he leaves... walks with great difficulty through the yard, flanked by Trustees. The iron cuffs cutting into Billy's ankles...step by step... A few Samurai hang around...Billy keeps walking. face to face, both high, smoking heroin, lying under blankets to avoid being seen by Guards. The effects of the drug hit Billy hard. He crawls out of the blanket amidst a plume of SMOKE. Slumps back against a wall, sweating, heart pounding, eyes/lungs burning... Thru Billy's haze he/we see/hear...a Thai pop-music video playing on a small tv, sealed to the wall...Fans whirring... Kiaw's lighter sparking under a blanket...Smoke and heat rising... Then, cell boss, Keng, sits up and signals to other Samurai. One by one, three then four then five get up, and quietly scale over other prisoners sleeping...making their way toward the Young Thai inmate . 37. Billy stares, unsure what's happening. Suddenly, Keng and five Samurai throw themselves onto the Young Thai, cover his mouth and rape him. Billy tries to move. Can't. The attack's silent. Terrifying, crack eggs, scramble, pour, flip and fold them. The stoves are electric. PRISONERS wait in line for omelets, then move to a gallery of lawn chairs and eat. sit on buckets, using toothbrushes to scrub their ankles beneath their shackles. Their eyes are hollow, black circles from weeks of abuse. Track marks visible. Billy scrubs roughly...His ankle starts to bleed. He keeps scrubbing. Suddenly the sound of HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS WHISTLING, making CAT-CALLS in Thai. Billy and Kiaw look up -- Jom -- in a long wig and makeup -- is being escorted through the yard by TRUSTEES. She swings her hips with exaggerated sexiness, like a peacock flaunting it's feathers. Billy is surprised at how attractive she looks. Jom sees Billy, waves and calls out to him: Hey, farang ba! You think me beautiful? Billy just watches. No words. Jom enters a shop with an encaged window for protection. The Trustees lock her in. Ready for business... is trying to find cigarettes from one of the shops and stands. It's loud, unruly: DOZENS OF PRISONERS all bargaining, arguing, shoving at once. Billy gestures over the noise. Every SHOP OWNER refuses him. ANGLE, JOM behind the counter of a CAGED-IN SHOP. She's selling cigarettes, toiletries, coffee, homemade Valentine cards, etc, along with May and Char. 38.  Hello. How I can help you? ...cigarettes... Five dollar.  Can I buy `em on credit?  -- I'm expecting some cash from me mum. William Moore. I know... I give you fifty dollar credit. Pay me back when you can?  -- I never thanked you for fixin' me head. So... You want, I can be your sexy girlfriend... 39. Billy's uncomfortable. VERY uncomfortable. So Jom just smiles and then he leaves. Jom watches him go. and a THIN SAMURAI trade cigarettes for straws of heroin. is hunched under a blanket. He cuts two lines of heroin on a bucket. Billy SNORTS one line, quickly switches nostrils, Billy's eyes press shut, to ESCAPE, for a moment. SILENCE... precious silence... Billy lifts an edge of the blanket, peers out: Thin Samurai sits there, smoking a cigarette, watching him. Thin Samurai smiles, puts the cigarette out on his tongue. Then he eats it. Billy just looks at him. Then -- hands. His head is bowed as Keng uses the CROOKED KNIFE we saw earlier to shave Young Samurai's scalp...Slowly, methodically...hair falls in bits, revealing Young Samurai's scalp is full tattooed with the image of a DRAGON. Billy watches this ritual, nightmarish and surreal -- is alone at the bars. Arms slung over the crossbars, smoking a cigarette. Quiet, sullen. It's DAWN - faint Buddhist and Muslim CHANTING O.C. Kiaw hides a handful of heroin straws in a SHAMPOO BOTTLE. Billy notices. Kiaw looks at him, smiles. Billy picks up the carton of cigarettes. Only one pack left. When he opens it, he finds a small NOTE tucked inside between cigarettes. Billy mumbles low, as he reads --  "Hi Billy.  40. You missing me, yes or no?...I want you be a good man for me, Billy. I can be a good person for you too...Can't say love now, but when everything okay, you will be the one, my boyfriend." At the bottom of the note, a lipstick mark. Signed: "Jom" Billy's jaw tenses. Silent. Disturbed. Then, we hear the sound of MEN RUNNING. A lot of men. Billy looks up: THE MUAY THAI BOXING TEAM is doing wind sprints in the yard. Back and forth, powerful as horses, no one out there but them. Billy watches. One man coaching, looks up: NAN, smoking a cigarette. Eyes meet. And as the team keeps running... The chanting grows louder... Louder... Fearful... CUT TO: BLACK. A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS ACROSS THE PRISON GROUNDS...... and all his cellmates bolt up. Billy looks at Kiaw: Someone killed... lies mortally wounded -- the CROOKED SAMURAI KNIFE plunged into his chest, as Trustees quickly push him on a cart to-- where Officer Pi Sit + Guards have also found the corpses of Trustees #1 + #2, blood sodden, knife wounds bleeding out. Guards HEAVE the corpses onto PUSHCARTS. An ENRAGED Officer Pi Sit shouts in Thai at Guards and Trustees, and we-- 41. in riot gear -- move FAST and LOUD, charging into cells with batons, flashlights and DOGS -- shouting rapid-fire Thai as -- are violently grabbed, yanked out -- Their cells are ransacked -- bedding and pillows ripped apart -- bins dumped over -- false bottoms kicked out...sifting, searching... peers through the bars to get a glimpse of what's happening. We HEAR distant mayhem. Batons hitting flesh. Men screaming insanely. Billy turns to see all of the Samurai sitting in silence. Cross-legged, waiting. Only Keng looks at Billy...and gestures for him to stay quiet. The sound of beatings/screaming intensifies as the raid gets closer to their cell. Billy tries to swallow his fear, but it's impossible. We begin hearing FOOTSTEPS somewhere. Lots of them. Coming hard and fast. HEAVY KEYS jangling. Billy steps back. He blinks. crash in. So fast, so frightening, giving us only glimpses -- and other Samurai are roughly grabbed and thrown in line. A few Samurai protest/spit back -- Dogs bark and bite them -- Guards kick and punch them -- smashing batons across Samurai bare backs with relentless force. Billy sees another Samurai being dragged out by the hair. Contraband hits the floor: cell phones, chargers, pocket knives, spikes, shivs, drug paraphernalia, porn mags; Guards keep shouting -- Terrified prisoners are marched along landings -- down stairs -- Billy and Kiaw among them.... 42. Chaos everywhere, impossibly violent. Then; the ENTIRE PRISONER POPULATION stand in rows, nude, their clothes on the ground. For Billy, and those in shackles, their shorts/underwear are pulled to their ankles. their clothes. The dead bodies of Elyias, Trustees #1 + #2 displayed for all to see. Billy sees Nan and the Boxing Team amongst prisoners, also nude. Nan doesn't notice Billy. Then, TRUSTEES push Jom, May and Char to a distant corner, wearing bras and panties. For the first time, we see Jom without any makeup on. She looks at Billy, his pale, naked body amongst tattooed Samurai. Jom stares...Billy looks away...it's awkward. walks the line, tapping his baton against his leg, scanning prisoners' faces, a cold anger in his eyes... A paranoid Kiaw VERY SUBTLY kicks his shirt on the ground in front of Billy...but Billy doesn't notice. The Guards are getting closer, roughly searching prisoners and their clothes. balls, armpits, ass. Bull Guard grabs Kiaw's shirt off the ground are Billy's). Billy SEES they aren't his... Bull Guard folds back the seam of Kiaw's shirt: REVEALING A Billy glances at Kiaw in disbelief...Kiaw just stares ahead. Bull Guard rips the pocket out, finds: STRAWS OF HEROIN -- then shouts in Thai to Officer Pi Sit. Officer Pi Sit walks over. Takes the heroin. Bites open one straw, tastes the powder. Officer Pi Sit glares at Billy. 43. Those aren't mine. Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back. Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his; Billy shakes his head "no," frantic, terror stricken. Officer Pi Sit just keeps staring at him. As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from his hands and tries to put it on. Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off. Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT..... Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees. of the yard. Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still. Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door. There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS, followed by SOUNDS of footsteps scuffling -- A door being slammed -- A chair being dragged -- Kiaw being interrogated -- SILENCE. Then the SCREAMING begins. Billy and the prisoners are frozen, listening to the SOUND OF KIAW'S BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAMS as TRUSTEES SAVAGELY BEAT HIM The beating/screams/sobs broadcast across the entire prison. all staring at the speakers: NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. 44. A rather dark room, or lobby, filled with inmates lounging and smoking cigarettes. Billy is high, among them. The antechamber is connected to a small cell. And behind those bars: a dressed up Jom is singing Karaoke. May and Char sing back-up, lyrics roll on a shitty tv, as Jom sings into a microphone. It's a slow, very seductive Thai BALLAD... his eyes glazed, watching Jom through the smoke...as do all the other inmates. The room pulses slowly. Billy is totally captivated by Jom's singing and stares without blinking. Jom looks right at Billy, as if singing just for him. With the effects of the drugs -- DREAMLIKE, SURREAL -- Jom becomes emotional as she sings, appearing like a star...an angel... For Billy, forgetting the prison surroundings for just this moment, he's trancelike...mesmerized...as if he and Jom are alone. Even the cell bars disappear; When the song ends, Billy continues watching Jom and everyone else loudly APPLAUDS. The usual chaos and activity. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over the loudspeaker: TRUSTEE'S VOICE William Moore, yat yeim...William Moore, yat yeim No sign of Billy. Instead, he -- lies inert on his blanket, alone in the cell. A shirt covers his face. Kiaw's shampoo bottle is open, empty, next to him. stands over, puts a boot on Billy's chest. No response. He yanks the shirt off Billy's face. Billy's mouth is wide, eyes rolled back. Looks like a corpse. Bull Guard lifts Billy's head, shakes it. Then harder. Billy is totally limp. Bull Guard gives him a VIOLENT KICK to the ribs. Billy's eyes snap back in place. He wakes up, as if from a coma. 45. Bull Guard shouts something in Thai. Billy doesn't get up, zombie-like. Bull Guard yanks him to his feet, throws a sky-blue uniform shirt on him, and drags him out of the cell. is dragged in by Bull Guard, chains jangling. He's dumped onto a stool before a STEEL MESH PARTITION. Billy almost falls over. Bull Guard sits him up straight. Billy is badly disheveled, bloodshot eyes, grey skin, unshaven, beyond high. To his left and right, PRISONERS shout back and forth to VISITORS on the opposite side -- ten feet apart -- divided by bars/mesh. A BABY cries. It's madness. Like talking across a freeway. BILLY'S POV swims for a moment to an OUT OF FOCUS VISITOR seated on the other side of the mesh... As Billy blinks, strains to see, the Visitor comes INTO FOCUS revealing: NINDAM  He stares at Billy in shock. Shock of his decay. Shock of time gone by. Billy looking back, his bloodshot eyes moving down to: BILLY'S POV -- NINDAM'S HANDS, holding a small TROPHY. He grips it nervously, speaking slow and distinct; unsure if Billy understands: ...Billy...you hear me? Billy's mouth moves: no words come out. I win tournament. In Bangkok. Muay Thai, number one. Billy tries to respond. Strains to focus...Can't. Then, Nindam sadly sets an OLD GYM BAG on the divider: Billy's gym bag. This from gym locker. We wait long time. Can no more keep for you...  Sorry. 46. Billy clenches his jaw-- a flood of emotion roils inside him. Nindam FEELS it too, trying to be brave... Next time I fight...when you leave here, me want you walk me to ring. Billy tries to smile. It falls quickly;  ...bye, Billy... Billy nods -- fighting back tears. Nindam, staring at him. Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer... bye. As Billy stands, Bull Guard searches him, checks his chains. Nindam watches desperately. After a moment, Billy turns back to look at Nindam... ...He's gone. Billy, seeing it...feeling every fucking bit of it... Time has passed. He sits alone, clean shaven, writing a letter in pencil. We see GLIMPSES of his crude, childlike handwriting: "...I know how difficult this is...""...I made a mistake..." "...no one to blame but myself..." is having his chains removed by the Blacksmith. Officer Pi Sit stands nearby with Bull Guard; After the shackles are pried off, Billy stretches his legs. The lack of weight is relieving. Bull Guard signals Billy to sit on the floor. He does, then; 47.  I want to fight. You already did that. I mean with the team. I need to fight... You understand me. It's you who no understand.  Boxing come with good behavior, long time. We have prison tournament each year, government allowed. A chance for boxers at life, privilege...and honor.  You've earned nothing, William Moore. So let me fight. I need it to change. That's something... No. Will you mail this? It's for me mum. 48. Billy watches, uncomfortable, as Pi Sit reads the letter inside. After a silence, he nods to Billy that he'll mail it. is working, selling. She wears a tight t-shirt that says, "GUILTY" across the front. Muscular Trustee stands sentry. without his chains, approaches the shop and Jom smiles, bats her eyelashes. Hi, Billy! Missed you!  Long time, I thought you got released... I, uh...I need cigarettes. A lot of `em. You need for drugs? Billy looks at Muscular Trustee.  Relax. He no speak English. -- No, it's not for that. Not this time. Billy's hand is on the counter. Jom watches his expression as she reaches through the bars, slowly...and lays her hand on his. The tips of her fingers brush Billy's scarred knuckles, lightly back and forth. He's uncomfortable, and slides his hand back. I can pay you back. I mean, I will. They look at each other for a moment, then... I believe you. She gives him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES, then discreetly hands him another LOVE NOTE. Billy pockets it. 49.  What they for? through the heat and congested yard. He grips the cigarette carton in one hand, his old gym bag in the other. He pulls Jom's note from his pocket, throws it away without reading it. Then Billy looks, walks with steely determination toward -- -- and reaches for the gate. From inside, a BAMBOO STICK comes down hard. Billy yanks his hand back...It's Nan. You speak English?  ...Some. Billy holds up the carton of cigarettes. Says intensely: Let me train, and they're yours. BEAT. HOLD. THEN: Nan draws back the gate. Takes the cigarettes. Billy enters. work out. It's very loud. Desk Guard in the corner. stands ringside, and wraps his own hands. Nan lights a cigarette and watches as Billy pulls a small jar of Vaseline from his gym bag and greases up his face, then inserts his old mouthpiece and bites down. Last, he pulls out his old boxing gloves . Billy puts them on, looks to Nan to lace them. As Nan laces Billy's gloves, he sees the SCARS on Billy's arm and looks at him. Billy says nothing. Nan finishes tying the gloves. Billy climbs into the ring, THROUGH the ropes...and waits. 50. Chok! 51. Billy mops the floor. The Boxers resume training. When Billy finishes, he shoves the gate back, and leaves. his back to us, as he angrily breaks a block of ice in a bucket, stabbing it repeatedly with a bike cog. wrapped in a towel against his face. His head is throbbing, ribs and legs hideously bruised and swollen... He takes the ice pack off, revealing bad facial damage: Black eyes, forehead knotted with welts. Dried blood in his nose. He runs a finger inside his mouth, spits blood on the ground. Billy sets the ice-pack on the back of his neck, and hangs his head. A portrait of abject loneliness. sits among Samurai as Bull Guard takes head count. When Billy yells his number: "paet" -- Bull Guard SEES Billy's welts and bruises and calls a halt to the count. Bull Guard shouts something in Thai at Billy. Billy doesn't understand; Bull Guard then shouts at Keng and a few others in Thai fucked this guy up?! He looks like shit, who did this?!") The Samurai all deny it. Bull Guard storms out. The Samurai glare at Billy...a VERY uncomfortable tension. stands in line. Other prisoners chatter in Thai. Billy says nothing. Surrounded, yet alone. lies awake. Everyone else sleeps. 52. And he thinks, realizes he's not a fighter...but wants to be. is watching the team train. He hears someone outside BANG on the gate and walks over: it's Billy. His bruised face. What you want? Billy presses a new carton of CIGARETTES against the gate. walk onto the main floor, passing the Desk Guard. Billy watches the boxers hitting bags, mitts, skipping ropes, sparring, getting massages, etc. They all ignore him; Lek is pounding a heavy bag. He stops and looks at Billy. Lek smiles, nods...Billy nods back. There's a mutual respect in this exchange. Nan sits on the steps of the ring and lights a cigarette. stretches alone...the bruises and welts make it difficult. Billy jumps rope. His legs are sore. Feet get tangled. Billy's slow on the heavy bag. Sweats profusely, breathing hard. Skills/body gone dormant from drugs. Billy does sit-ups hanging off a bench. Grimaces thru a set. No one holds his legs. Billy shadowboxes before a large mirror. He watches the other boxers, and tries to emulate their movements... ...then, Billy sees his own reflection: the face/body of a drug addict. Inward/outward decay. Billy can't look at himself. As Nan finishes his last cigarette, CUT TO: 53. sit and talk; The other Boxers are cooling down, packing up gear, talking. Desk Guard waits.  You fight before? Boxing, six years. As a kid, I won the Northwest area in England. No Muay Thai? ...Not much. Father train you?  When he used me as a punching bag, I might've learned some. BEAT. -- Why you want fight? You in danger?  It helps me forget where I am. When the gloves are on,-- I don't have pain. Drugs no do that? BEAT. HOLD. THEN:  I don't want to die. Nan stares at him...nods.   Then: How long you got here? 54. One hundred years. are herded back to their cells. Guards lock them in. train together, using focus pads. Time has passed, the wounds on Billy's face/body look better. Time, work! Billy fires combos -- as Nan catches with the pads -- no pause -- teaching rhythm -- pushing Billy to his limits -- He's clearly exhausted -- so Nan pushes even harder -- leaving his system. One of the Boxers hands him a bottle of water. Billy is surprised by the gesture, and drinks. swim in a whiskey bottle filled with water. WIDEN, REVEAL: All 70 Samurai crowded around, loudly making bets -- holding up cigarettes -- on which fish will win. is among them, surrounded on all sides by Samurai. Billy gestures/insists to Keng he wants to bet. The Samurai ignore him, a few insult him. Keng shouts at Billy to show him cigarettes. On my account...  My account... Billy keeps gesturing, pointing to which fish he wants to bet on, bluffing an amount. 55. Finally, Keng nods -- he shouts in Thai at Thin Samurai, who shakes the whiskey bottle up, then sets it down -- The agitated fish begin to circle, then fight...Nipping and thrashing...scales and blood floating... All the Samurai scream/shout, push/shove. Billy is nervous, hoping his fish will win. It does. He exhales. Some Samurai cheer, others are mad. Cigarettes wildly exchange. Billy doesn't get his. He points to the fish he bet on. Samurai refuse to pay. More shoving and shouting. Billy shoves back; One Samurai, in a rage, grabs the whiskey bottle and SMASHES Billy watches the fish flop on the ground and die. Keng, staring at him, signals to the Samurai to pay Billy his cigarettes. They finally do. gets up, dresses quickly. First one to leave, while the Samurai are asleep. runs laps alone around the crowded yard, trying to navigate the madness. The PRISON FOOTBALL TEAM get into a fight during a game. All of them shouting and shoving... Billy runs through it; Jom is working behind her cage. Billy walks up...She's happy to see him. Hello, Billy! How my Westerner boyfriend...? He drops a shoebox on her counter: it's filled with all the cigarettes he won. 56. Jom looks at them. You don't need to send me no more love letters. Jom's smile falls. I can't be your boyfriend. I just can't...and never will be. Thanks anyway. Jom's eyes well up. Billy walks away... is in line behind three other Boxers in the ring. Across from them, stands a ripped powerful fighter: PON . One at a time, each Boxer challenges Pon to grappling combat, until one of them is thrown to the floor. Billy watches as Pon destroys each opponent with astonishing speed and strength. Then, it's Billy's turn. Pon grins and waves him forth. Billy moves in and -- slam into a clinch. Working hard, Billy takes the brunt of the pain. He pushes Pon, the stronger man, toward the ropes...They grapple aggressively. Then, Pon picks up Billy and tosses him 180 degrees with his power. Billy hits the canvas like a rag doll. Stunned. Pon just laughs...He's extremely dangerous. waits alone with a Trustee in the empty yard. Eyes bleary, Billy just woke up. 57. Trustee gestures that Billy's allowed to join; Billy hesitates, then starts to jog...and falls in line... through different SECTORS of the empty prison. Some shadowbox while running. Billy struggles to keep pace, huffing and puffing. But then he realizes...he's jogging through areas of the prison that he's never seen... Streaks of dawn light the sky. Cool morning air. For Billy, he feels ALIVE...and smiles. is hitting the pads as Tane holds them. Billy fires fist/shin combos. Hard shots resound. Sweat pours off Billy ...his skill clearly improving. Nan stands at the ropes, giving instructions. breathing. He suddenly FREEZES.... is in the gym. Two GUARDS with him. They stare at Billy. Why you here? ... I warned you. Made very clear, you must earn this. And how you do that? By defying me--?  I have earned this. Officer Pi Sit says something in Thai to the Guards. Then turns to Billy: 58. You will be punished for a month. Whole cell will be punished too.  I give you one chance: You will fight at Songkran. thanks. Who am I fightin'?  Could be yourself. You know what is Songkran? No. Thai New Year. In three weeks: all prison celebrates...Boxers fight to qualify for National tournament. 59. is on a scale. All the Boxers are checking their weights for Songkran. The gym is crowded with Guards and Officer Pi Sit, who supervises. Outside the gym gate: DOZENS OF PRISONERS have gathered to watch, deciding who they'll bet on. Among them, are the SAMURAI. Pon makes weight: 175 Next, Billy steps on. Pi Sit leans in to read Billy's weight: 210 lbs.  The fuck? Is the scale broke? Billy looks down: Someone else's foot is on the scale: Pon. He grins, malevolent. Billy heels Pon's leg off. Officer Pi Sit watches without expression. On the verge of erupting...Billy gets off the scale, Nan resets, and Billy gets back on. Pon inches up behind...blows in Billy's ear, then whispers something we can't hear. Billy makes weight: 175 Then, he reels and throws a punch that doesn't land, because they're separated. Shouting. Pushing. The entire team now, the Guards-- CUT OUT; celebrate. The yard is alive with festivities. Carnivalesque. performs a romantic Thai song. Prisoners and Guards are mixing, eating, dancing to music, throwing water in all directions and laughing. Everyone in high spirits... emerge, carrying the RING out to the sunlit yard, where they set it down. THE SOUND OF A CELEBRATION FILLS THE AIR.... Billy stand with Lek, watching, in disbelief. 60. Then, a prisoner runs by and hurls A BUCKET OF WATER on Billy. He's soaked, freezing. Lek starts laughing, as-- ANGLE, THE BUDDHA STATUE Two Prisoners on stools pour flowered water over it, as others pray, light incense and candles. A LINE OF BUDDHIST MONKS young and old, in bright orange robes, move through the yard, as the far as the eye can see. Billy SEES Prisoners and Guards flock to the Monks, kneeling, making offerings of fruit and ornaments. In return, the Monks give blessings, sprinkling sacred water with a stick on the prisoners' hands and faces... ANGLE, A YOUNG MONK that summons Billy forth. Billy hesitates, then steps closer. The Young Monk smiles and applies the sprinkles Billy's face. He doesn't know what it means. Doesn't need to. It feels peaceful. AND AS MUSIC WIDEN. THE WHOLE YARD IS CELEBRATING. Only the ring is empty. Then, Black Dildo voice booms over the microphone: Lady-boys and gentlemen, iiiiittt's is fighting THAI BOXER #2. They trade shots. Then, a HUGE Billy stands outside the ring, gloves on, just inches from the ko'd boxer's face. We SEE the FEAR on Billy's face. As the REFEREE  tries to revive him, he sharply signals to Billy that he fights next. Lek exits the ring, pats Billy's shoulder and smiles, encouraging him. 61. Billy swallows, then climbs the steps to the ring, and we -- TIMECUT/SMASH TO: sits as Tane and another CORNERMAN shout advice fast/loud in Thai, over the noise of the crowd. As-- fills the frame. It's soaked with BLOOD. Go behind it as Nan is working Billy's corner. He's breathing hard, his EAR IS How bad is it? Is it bad? Not good. His elbow done it, the cunt. Next round not for you. Your ear almost come off. Fuck that. I got another one. Billy looks to the crowd: Everyone from Songkran going crazy, gambling. Keng and Samurai betting big on Pon. In the front row: is Officer Pi Sit, arms folded, watching stoically. JOM, in a short skirt and high heels, walks the ring w/a CARD who looks away, annoyed. rush in. Trade heavy shots. FISTS, KNEES and SHINS... Their bodies absorbing the shock. Pon GRINDS HIS GLOVE into Billy's ear. Blood and white cells pour. It's hard to watch. Billy reacts and fires a three-punch flurry that lands, then Pon steps over and hammers a hook to Billy's exposed kidney. Billy drops to one knee, air leaves him, pain engulfing him. 62. As the REFEREE  counts, Billy looks to the crowd: going nuts. Samurai sensing victory. Then, he SEES Nan who signals Billy to rise.... ....and he does. A split-second, and Pon charges. Billy blocks A RAGE OF PON'S HEAD SHOTS and KNEES, doing his best to cover. A FIST SLAMS through Billy's guard, like a shotgun. Billy comes off the rope and hits Pon with a vicious three- shot combo, right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM. Feints. Then a solid OVERHAND RIGHT that BREAKS the bridge of Pon's nose. look of defiance -- The crowd ROARS for Billy, as he goes to his corner and sits; Nan works Billy's arms and legs; How's the ear? Still there. Jom walks the ring with a CARD FOR ROUND 5. This time, she blows Billy a kiss...taunting him. Billy gets even madder...Nan slaps him hard across the face.  Last round, Billy! Must knock out or lose fight! Ready to finish him off; slams us right into mid-round five. Billy covers. Pon -- insulting, taunting -- grapples with Billy, cursing through his mouthpiece... Pon launches a short right that Billy counters with a BIG And Billy goes for the kill. 63. A HARD RIGHT CROSS SLAMS HOME on Pon's face -- knocking him to the canvas with a HEAVY THUD, out cold. No need to count. The Ref waves it over, removes Pon's mouthpiece: it's a bloody mess. The Crowd erupts. The Samurai, staring, simmering. Officer Pi Sit, in disbelief. Pon lays unconscious, as Cornermen try to revive him. As Billy, drapes his arms over the corner, and breathes...he looks up, sees Jom being escorted out by Trustees. A beat of regret; lies on a bench as a THAI CUTMAN stitches up Billy's ear. stand nearby...all shouting/cursing/spitting/vehement in Thai, angry at having lost their bets. FOUR GUARDS stand post, keeping them back, as -- Two THAI BOXERS fight in the ring, the tournament hasn't stopped. The crowd going wild. We can see the pain in Billy's face. celebrate. The courtyard empty, but them and two Guards. Billy  with Lek and the team, bathing their WOUNDS, their CUTS, their SWOLLEN LIMBS from their own fights at Songkran. They laugh and throw water, for the moment, as if children. Nan is with them, smoking, smiles. his ear bandaged, enters with a GUARD. Pi Sit waits at his desk. Billy sits on the floor, placing his hands together, as a mark of respect. After a moment: Your fight at Songkran was impressive. Insane, but impressive. ... 64.

As Billy heads for the door, he looks back at Keng, who gestures a knife cutting Billy's throat. Billy walks out. and Guards as they escort him across the yard...into a separate, WOOD BUILDING and move down a long, dark hall in silence. Billy is led into a LARGE CELL and first sees the ...Then, suddenly, Billy discovers Nan, Lek and the ENTIRE Nak Geela"). All the boxers cheer and whistle, call him "Crazy Farang." All except Pon. Billy, bewildered by it all, dives into the team. All of them laughing and wrestling. is awake, as everyone else sleeps. Billy reads the letter from his Mum quietly to himself; Deep emotion fills Billy's face. He wipes his eyes. loudly drag their batons along the bars of the team cell, waking Billy, Nan and the Boxers. 66. A Guard gives them a head count. The yard is very still, very quiet. As the sun dips low, the boxing team, in silhouette, jogs laps around the courtyard. Billy runs among the them...He sees a rapist Samurai, naked, hands tied behind his back, being forced to roll in the yard, while getting kicked and humiliated by Guards. Billy looks up at the Sector 5 Cell, sees the rest of the Samurai behind bars, watching. Billy keeps jogging... lies on his stomach in the dark, amidst a circle of Boxers, conducting a sacred Sak Yant tattoo ritual. It's EXTREMELY HOT, EXTREMELY INTENSE. Lek and two Boxers hold Billy down, as another: TIGER uses a 40cm long needle  to apply the ink onto Billy's back with fast, repeated jabs....the image of a LEAPING TIGER beginning... Billy fights the pain, holding it in; The boxers invoke a deep, hypnotic mantra , some clutching amulet fragments, the chanting becomes ONE VOICE... CU's. Billy's pores, needle scraping ink made of snake venom, and jabbing. Lek wipes blood off Billy's back, revealing the Leaping Tiger and SAK YANT tattoos forming. Billy's eyes roll back, the mantra inducing a trance state. As Nan blows into the tattoo, the Boxers become shadows, silhouettes...The cell walls fading. All we see is Billy. All we hear is chanting... walks alone, thinking. Time has passed. His bandage is gone. Billy watches the swirl of activity from a distance. Prisoners eating in the outdoor kitchen. And Jom, in her shop, selling wares...engaging with prisoners. Billy stares for a moment...then keeps walking. 67. are crowded around a long table. Plates/bowls of fish, ant eggs, crab somtam, chicken, pork, chiang-mai noodles are passed around as Billy and the boxing team eat. AD LIB talking/joking/banter. Hey Crazy farang, why you in prison? ...Drugs... What kind? All of `em. The Team laughs. Billy can't help but smile. How `bout you? No, I no do drugs...I just kill. Thai Boxer pounds his own chest, as if stimulating a knife stabbing. The Team LAUGHS harder....so Billy laughs too. in protective gear, spar and grapple. Flesh on flesh impact. Nan stands at the ropes, instructing. Billy gets thrown down. Nan yells at him to get up. Billy jumps up and re-engages. Lek throws him down again. Billy pounds the canvas with his fist, in frustration. Nan signals Billy to exit the ring. Two more Boxers climb in. are given head count by a Guard at night. 68. sit together, looking at a PHOTO ALBUM of Lek's family. Lek points to things in the photos, then teaches Billy how to say them in Thai: ..."my house"..." "...my son..." "...my temple..." "...my father..." Billy repeats each in Thai.    Then: Do you have father? Billy pauses, then nods "yes." He come visit you? ...no...we don't talk anymore. shadowboxes before the large mirror. He looks strong, fast. Now, comfortable facing his reflection. leaving the gym, walks out to his locker. He opens it, shoves his gym bag inside, shuts it. Then, Billy turns to see someone standing there. It's Kiaw. Cold stare at Billy. Kiaw...When'd they let you out? When I heal. Billy sees new scars on Kiaw's face. They're unnerving. I haven't got time for this. Your hair look good... --What? 69. You take my shampoo bottle-- smoke all heroin inside it. Billy's silent. Then: So? You was gonna throw me to the guards...Now we're even. That heroin belong to Samurai. Cost much money! That's your problem... Kiaw persists, getting angry: You pay now.  I don't owe you nothin'. sharply gestures to Billy and Kiaw to move on. Billy walks away. Kiaw steps in his path: You know I have AIDS. You pay my debt to Samurai or I inject you with my blood. Kiaw holds Billy's stare: it's murderous. Then, he leaves. and a few other BOXERS sit on a bench, having their training injuries treated by DOCTORS: cut knuckles, cut lips and eyebrows, hyper-extended knees, black-eyes. Billy, still angry, is having his bruised ribs taped. A GERMAN INMATE in his 60's -- pale, fat, sweaty -- sits on another bench, waiting, eating a plate of food. Near the medical hatch, Jom is talking to a MUSCULAR TRUSTEE, fanning herself with a Chinese fan and flirting. She notices Billy-- glancing over, then ignores him and struts toward the other Boxers, as if an audience: 70. ...You good fighters, not bad. My father want me to be Muay Thai, like him. But his dream not mine. I start taking hormones when I was fifteen. Father say I bring great shame, and he disown me. Billy--) But now I am who I want to be. Happy with myself. My only regret is I should have had kids before I cut my dick off. Well me, I like to fuck `em younger. Much younger...Dick or no dick, it don't matter.  How many cigarettes to suck me off? You, Westerner-- what your problem?! -- I haven't got a problem, I've got cigarettes. Are you going to blow me or not--?! 71. -- Shut your mouth, or I'll bash your fuckin' skull in, nob head! Billy--) Fuck off, faggot! Open your eyes... I SAID, OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES!!!  BILLY, NO! CALM DOWN! LET HIM GO!  You scare me, farang...very crazy! Can no control yourself! -- You, you're just a whore! 72. Jom's eyes go wide with shock. Anger. -- You make everything bad! You fucking junkie! Will never change! You think too much!  Mi dong kit mak! much!) Billy, held by Boxers, looks at her -- His rage replaced by shame. I no want see you, farang ba!  Don't ever come around me! Jom leaves down a hall w/Muscular Trustee, who comforts her. Billy is led toward the exit by the Boxers, but he keeps staring after Jom. He feels rejected. unleashing a hailstorm of violent Thai kicks, pounding the bag -- harder and harder, yelling out with each attack. are in the ring, demonstrating the Ram Muay ritual dance. They each wear a "mongkhon"  and "pra jiad" . Wai Khru music plays on an old radio. Billy and Nan, also in the ring, stand near the ropes. Ram Muay...before each fight, we pledge respect to spirits. Nan points/bows/prays AROUND the ring: the ropes, the canvas, the gloves, the fighters themselves... --Bless...spirit...bless...spirit, bless... Billy watches Lek and the boxer gracefully move through a series of rhythmic gestures and postures. 73. Billy is deep in a stew of his own confusion, trying to hide his state of mind from the others.  Now you. I'm no dancer. Can no compete tournament without. Billy doesn't move. Nan shoots him an angry look. Muay Thai more than just "fight." Disrespect spirits or no believe, you never understand Muay Thai! I "believe." No--!  When you at peace, can control anything, and win. Anger: lose everything. among the entire Boxing Team, and Football Team, as they kneel for Buddhist Evening Prayer . Chanting fills the cell, and Billy watches them, isolated and apart. His thoughts elsewhere. is nailed with a punch in this sparring session. A combo of bounces off the ropes. Lek looks over at Nan, who is standing on the ring apron, watching: Billy is NOT throwing back. Hands up! 74. Billy takes a kick to the chest. Then another. Lek gives an imploring look, then fires a series of PUNCHES; Billy just takes it, refusing to cover. Lek knees his ribs, and Billy slumps forward into a clinch. Lek shoves Billy off, paws with a jab...concerned. Suddenly, Billy dips and CRASHES A HOOK ON LEK'S JAW -- stunning him. As Lek staggers, Billy unleashes FOUR DEVASTATING PUNCHES AND Billy! Hya Suk!  Other Boxers stop training now, looking over, as-- Billy is shocked at what he's done. So is Nan, as he quickly goes to Lek's aid. Billy storms out of the ring, rips off his gloves with his teeth, then slams them in a trash bin and leaves... Desk Guard hurries after him. The rest of the Boxers, confused, watch Billy go. is walked in by Desk Guard, holding his belongings. He's been transferred to another cell: 12 square feet. Only five Thai inmates inside. As the Desk Guard shuts the bars, Billy hears someone giggle. He turns to see Noi -- the mentally retarded inmate from earlier. No one else says a word. 75. condemned in here for a week. No talking. Very little light. In the days/nights that follow.... Billy pounds the wall with his fist. Slow, heavy thuds, that come one after another. Billy pumps out sit-ups. Billy does furious push-ups. Noi watches Billy, giggling. Billy stops and looks at him. Billy does push-ups with Noi on his back. Guards enter, drop off food, then lock the bars again. Billy and Noi sit/eat together. Noi smiles. Billy smiles back. Prisoners' clothes hang on a wire. Billy rips it down and uses it as a jump rope. As he does, Billy's eyes glaze over, somewhere else. Billy/Cellmates sleep, inches apart. Noi right next to Billy. Guards enter again. Drop off food. Shut the bars. In back of the cell/shower, Billy helps Noi bathe. Then dries him off with a towel. Later, Billy stands with a DULL RAZOR and starts to shave his own head. Intense expression on his face; All the prisoners watch in ominous silence. A few drops of blood stream down the back of Billy's scalp and neck. His head now shaved, he now shaves off his eyebrows...leaving the skin underneath beaded in blood. Guards bring in food; shut the bars. Billy starts shadowboxing. FIRING COMBOS that get faster and harder -- More and more violent... The other prisoners move back, nervous, afraid -- Except Noi. Billy keeps punching, pivoting, attacking...dripping with sweat. The combos coming with blazing force and speed -- 76. Billy finally stops, drops to his knees. Noi applauds, his eyebrows shaved as well. Noi gives Billy water, smiles. And for the first time, Billy SPEAKS in THAI: Pom chuu Billy khrap? Billy) Khoun chuu aray? your name). Noi giggles. It's still and quiet. Everyone in their cells, asleep. are sitting in their cell, quietly. Lek, among them, still with bruises. There's a sound of the door opening and a figure walks in: It's Billy...released from punishment. Brought in by Desk Guard. Everyone stares. Billy tries to gather courage as he walks up to Nan. There's a long moment before he speaks: I fucked up. I know it, Nan. Honest. Nan says nothing... I just lost it, is all. I lost me self,-- everything you taught me.  If I could, I'd rip me own heart out and show it to you...  I didn't come this far to quit. Nan stares. Silent. Billy tries not to break down. 77. Then, Nan hands Billy a pair of BOXING SHORTS. Billy looks down, sees the name written on them: "CRAZY FARANG" Tournament very soon. Must train twice as hard now. Don't disappoint me. Billy nods, quietly comes alive.  I forgot cigarettes. I no more smoke. Bad for health. Billy's back on the team. He walks to Lek and sits down next to him. There's a moment...Then, Lek holds out a fist...Billy bumps it, both smile. holds a rope between his teeth, that's tied to a weight. He lifts it up and down, strengthening his neck. walks in the strangely almost empty courtyard. Like an uncomfortable dream. Suddenly he SEES in the distance... sitting alone, on the ground. He's sad, dejected, for once not smiling. Billy walks over. Noi sees Billy and his mood changes immediately. He runs to him with his moldy FLIP-FLOPS split down the middle; BILLY!!! Noi hugs Billy tight. You need new shoes... Noi doesn't respond. 78. Billy speaks in Thai: Rong tow, see lao. not good) Noi looks up, grunts. Roo lao!  Pom Ja sue longtow mai hai khun na.  Noi, a huge smile...He removes his flip-flops, gives them kiss, then HURLS them over the prison wall. He then marches quickly away, singing a Thai song loudly and out of tune. are at a stand, rummaging through items for sale. The shop owner is a VERY OLD THAI PRISONER. Billy inspects items: coffee, shaving cream, soup cans...They agree on the flip=flops that Noi likes. As Noi tries them on, Billy then moves to a row of feminine items: lipstick, eye shadow, a woman's headband with a plastic flower attached. He looks up at the Old Man watching him. Billy picks up the flower headband;  ...it's not for me... The Old Man SMILES. Noi looks at Billy, concerned. Hopes it's not for him. Shakes his head, "no." Billy is amused. Both laugh. is alone in the empty chamber, practicing the Ram Muay dance. The music plays on a bad radio...His movements are stiff, uncomfortable. He's clearly frustrated. 79. There's a sound. Billy turns; REVEAL: JOM is standing outside the chamber. She wears the hair band with the plastic flower. Two TRUSTEES stand sentry as Jom enters the chamber and walks to Billy. Billy stares at her in silence. Emotion roiling through him. They look at each for a long, unspoken moment. Then Jom steps back and begins to perform the Ram Muay dance. Billy watches, transfixed as she teaches. It's strange and spiritual. Her movements graceful, yet surprisingly powerful. Now, Billy tries, following Jom's lead. Back and forth...She guides him along, together...both moving like water. Both smile.    Forgiving. are sparring. The gym is otherwise empty except for Nan, Tane and the Desk Guard.  engage, grapple, then fight out. It's intense, but more for technique, ironing out Billy's flaws. Mid-round, Pon CRASHES a shin into Billy's kidney. Billy takes it. Covers and assaults, aggressively going after Pon. is sweating profusely. Faster! Let hands and feet go! Billy takes a labored breath, nods. Billy circles, on the defensive. Pon cuts down the ring and tries to nail him, but Billy avoids and clinches. He's having trouble breathing... Pon wrestles Billy to the ropes. Billy hacks and splutters... a few FLECKS OF BLOOD spray onto Pon's shoulder. Only Billy notices... Something is wrong; 80. They break apart and Billy fends off more blows from Pon. walks in and shuts the door. Locks it. He stands there a moment, afraid. When suddenly and without warning -- a knife-like pain shoots through Billy's side -- his chest begins heaving -- with Nan, Pon, Tane follow Desk Guard back toward their cell. Nan... You okay?  ...yeah... Fear is good for fight. Like fire, inside you. Billy's silent, struggling to hide his pain from Nan. It's almost time. Billy considers telling Nan about his pain: He doesn't. BLACK. waits, alone. In the hallway, two other Westerner inmates wait on a bench. A MAN'S VOICE  Mr. Moore? Billy looks up: DR. ADI  has entered, holding a clipboard. 81. DR. ADI Mr. Moore, I am Dr. Adi. Never seen you here before... DR. ADI I come once a month to give medical aid to foreigners. DR. ADI How are you feeling? I'm not sure. DR. ADI You have a delineation of the esophagus. A what...? DR. ADI It's a tear. Primary cause: drug and alcohol abuse. Through years of this, it's worn away the lining of your esophagus. Well I'm sober now. DR. ADI You need to stay that way.  So can I get out of here...get back to the gym? DR. ADI You need to heal. After, exercise is good,-- but only moderate. I've got a tournament comin' up: Muay Thai. 82. DR. ADI Make other plans. Doc, I'm in prison. I haven't got no "other plans." BEAT. DR. ADI Boxing is what caused the rupture. You vomited blood because you had at least a pint in there. Any more trauma, and you could hemorrhage. You'll bleed to death. Billy looks at him. Dr. Adi starts to write on his clipboard. DR. ADI I'm putting in a request to have you transferred to a government hospital. They'll patch your esophagus, or perhaps cauterize it. I'll just, I'll keep my guard up. DR. ADI Mr. Moore -- -- I'll watch my pace. DR. ADI Mr. Moore. You must never fight again. steps out of the infirmary into the heat. He stands there, alone, looking around...a lost animal. stands at ring center, in full protective gear w/large pads -- one by one, five boxers take their turn unleashing rapid-fire Thai kicks , shouting with each shot. 83. It's fast. It's loud. It's relentless. is the last to go. Hoping to prove the doctor wrong. He attacks the bag. fast. loud. violent. REVEAL: NOI is in the gym now, sitting on the ring steps. He Nan points to a BROOM nearby. Nong Chai, Kub pai tum ngan khun na krub. work.) Noi quickly gets up, starts to sweep the gym. He's the new team assistant. Billy looks at Nan, nods "thanks." And Billy walks away. Light-headed, he clutches his chest, hiding the pain.  ...fuck... under the water. It flows down his neck and tattooed back. Cup after cup. He breathes in the cold...breathing in that place where fighters go...where emotion is stilled and eyes focus, concentrating. Then -- BILLY'S FACE plunges into water, FULL FRAME. Bubbles spiral, eyes peel open. Then, he whips his head back... ...out of a trough, as he stands in THE COURTYARD. He wipes water from his face. Then, sensing something in the distance, he instinctively turns... To his left: two Samurai. To his right: Kiaw and one more. Then Keng. All of them, staring. Billy freezes, staring back. Now, something in the Samurai's eyes goes dead and realization hits him... 84. Utter fucking Billy RUNS -- heart hammering, thru prisoner traffic as the Samurai give chase. Suddenly, KIAW catches Billy from behind, both go sprawling -- Billy, on his feet fast, STOMPS KIAW HARD -- then sprints away, as the other Samurai close in... -- bursts in, frenetic thru a maze of sheets. He gets tangled, screams, falls. AND ALL FIVE SAMURAI POUNCE, fists and feet...pounding Billy, trapped in the sheet, as-- Kiaw in Thai, who pulls out a SYRINGE and plunges it into his own veins...drawing out INFECTED BLOOD. Kiaw hands Keng the syringe, as the others hold Billy's neck. NO! NO!  You have tournament come up, yes? Billy frozen, wide-eyed, nods. Win fight and pay us your earnings. You lose, it end bad for you... Billy nods. The Samurai drops Billy in the dirt, then walk away. back in the cell with the entire Boxing Team and Football Team, as they kneel for Buddhist pre-dawn sutras. Chanting fills the cell. Billy shows Noi how to pray; They all pray together. 85. also praying. Lady Boys, Samurai, et al. In the COURTYARD, Muslims pray . All of it, hypnotic, tonal overlapping floods the air... The prayer before dawn. BLACK/HOLD IN BLACK/THEN: march in chains and shackles; gym bags in hand, some with boxing gloves tied around their necks. Guards watch the line. The yard is otherwise empty. All the prisoners, locked in their cells, watch the team pass. Billy sees: Jom in the Control Section. She smiles, waves through the fence. Billy nods, gratitude behind it. Then he glances at the Isolation Cell as he passes. They team is marched through a series of MASSIVE GATES and pull them open, showing us the outside.... step outside the prison gates. Billy pauses for a moment... taking in the open air. There's a few houses around, offices and empty lots. The slightest smile comes to his face. ANGLE, A WAITING PRISON BUS It's packed to the rafters with prisoners. Faces peer through steel-mesh. Billy follows the team into the bus... gets on. Prisoners crammed like cattle, everyone in chains. Billy squeezes through and sits next to Nan. They all here for the fight? Only boxers go to tournament. Billy looks to the back of the bus: a group of prisoners are caged in a smaller compartment, facing a Guard w/a shotgun. So where they headed? 86. Some get transfer. Others go to death house. shots of the prison bus, traveling through Thailand. watches scenery pass. People on the streets; temples; markets; life on the outside. As the bus moves through lush Evergreen forests...Billy leans against the mesh window, wind hitting his face. He breathes in clean air. + OTHER BOXERS enter. They're given a SECURITY CHECK. Guards search them and their gym bags. Chains and shackles are removed. Nearby, FAMILIES wait in line as their bags are inspected. It's huge, filled with people. Guards and Prisoners, Families visiting. Some play basketball, some gamble, others talk and laugh with their loved ones. Lady Boys, dressed as Ring Card Girls, are in a separate caged area, putting on makeup. In the center of the yard, a BOXING RING is being prepared: Prisoners set the canvas Corrections"); they secure the ropes, and corner pads. A gallery of chairs around it. sits alone. He watches other boxers with their families. Pon, Tiger, etc. Lek, holding and kissing his INFANT SON. Then, Billy looks away and quietly stares at the ring. ANGLE, OFFICER PI SIT. talking to Government Officials. He sees Billy sitting alone, walks over and sits. They both watch the families and prisoners interact for a moment. Then: I talked to your Mother. She could no afford airfare, but she sends her love. Billy is silent. 87. They say boxers should have no pleasure before fight. ... They say it softens you,-- steals your hunger. Well maybe "they" are full of shit. Officer Pi Sit smiles. Billy's loneliness is evident. The man you fight tonight, he no deserve to ever leave prison...So he'll do anything he can to win. BEAT, THEN: But you...  You had to go to prison in order to be free. Billy is still. Hard truth. lies on a table, in this improvised locker room. Nan is giving Billy a pre-fight massage...Applying heated oil to the skin, the scars, the back tattoo, working the muscles with his hands. It's very quiet but intense, ritualistic, as wel Lek, Tiger, a few other boxers enter the cell. All sweating, breathing hard, just having fought. Billy sits up. Alert. enters. Alone, he looks in the mirror, touches his chest nervously. Eyes closed, he prays. Focus and intensity builds... SHOUTING. MUAY THAI MUSIC on the loudspeakers. 88. There's a knock on the door. Billy opens it: It's time. -- as he pulls on his cup guard, then his shorts. -- as Nan tapes his hands. -- as an OFFICIAL signs the tape. -- as Lek ties Prajiads around his biceps -- a garland of flowers around his neck. -- then the gloves. -- Billy bows as Nan puts the Mongkhon on his head. He's ready. with Nan and Lek, as he leaves the cell and makes the VERY The TIGER TATTOO vibrant on Billy'S back. Prisoners cheering, some taunting, other reach through the bars and pat him... Billy keeps moving, eyes charged, fixed ahead, shadowboxing a few punches as he goes... into the bowels of THE YARD, where SIGHT/SOUNDS EXPLODE. Prison spotlights REVEAL THE YARD IS PACKED. Around the ring, a sea of prisoners. Guards in uniforms, Gov. Officials. Numerous families throughout. The NOISE builds to deafening levels as Billy makes his way toward the ring, and steps OVER the top rope... as he enters. And we're seeing him, now, at this moment, as a full Muay Thai warrior. Another ROAR sweeps over the crowd...His opponent entering the ring...And Billy turns to face the man who intends death for him: DIESEL CHOR . Prisoners ROAR for him. 89. Billy and Diesel walk the ring, opposite sides, praying to each corner, touching the ropes, "sealing" the ring... Ceremonial music begins...Billy and Diesel both perform the Ram Muay. As Billy moves rhythmically, in time to the music, his arms and legs telling his journey w/beatific precision... with May and Char are watching a small TV, chatting up a storm. Women's bras, thongs, hang on wires. Perfume and makeup abound. Jom watches Billy on TV intently, sees him perform the Ram Muay as she taught him. Ram Muay, the music cuts out. Billy locks eyes with Officer Pi Sit, ringside, for a moment. Then, Billy heads to his corner, lowers his head so Nan can remove the Mongkhon... They pray together, head-to-head... The crowd baying for blood, grows louder... LOUDER now... Then, suddenly, abruptly-- rush in. A measured pace at first. Billy and Diesel circling, feinting, like a storm brewing... Billy fires jabs and teeps with a balance and deftness we haven't seen before... Diesel, taking shots, trying to cut the ring, but Billy evades... UNTIL: DIESEL'S TRAINER shouts something Thai. And Diesel fires an OVERHAND RIGHT that Billy doesn't see and hits him like a pole-ax. Billy's entire body feels it.  A barrage of pulverizing kicks, elbows and punches follow, Billy trying to cover up. Diesel's attack goes through like bullets. It's fast. It's shocking. Hurts to watch. And -- 90.

He sees a light overhead and an air vent working. Billy takes a moment to get his bearings...Lying in a clean bed, white sheets, quiet surroundings. There's a large post- op bandage on his side where a drain was removed. Then Billy looks down, SEES his ankles are shackled/chained. A PATIENT in a neighboring bed stares at him awkwardly. slowly sits up, turns to a window, peers out; city of Bangkok -- 20 stories below. Billy pushes opens the window, BREATHING IN FRESH AIR...HE LOOKS OVER THE LEDGE...A There's a sudden SOUND. Billy drops back into bed, just as the door opens and a NURSE walks in.

Billy wraps the sarong around his waist, covering the chains. 96. as the Nurse escorts him...They pass a GUARD seated at a nearby desk. He hardly glances over from the TV he's watching. The Nurse leads Billy around the corner to the bathroom. She waits as he goes in alone. pisses in the urinal, then goes to the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his hands and face. Then walks out... ...and finds an empty corridor. The Nurse is gone. Billy peers around the corner, SEES the Nurse talking to an AIDE down the hall.

Billy nods, steps in, SLOW, careful not to shake the chains. avoids eye contact. Instead, he focuses on the floor lights dropping: 9...8...7- DING! Door opens: two more DOCTORS get in. Billy tenses. The descent resumes: 6- DING! Door opens again: now an back corner; Floor by floor, the elevator keeps stopping. Rapidly filling with NURSES, DOCTORS, ORDERLIES and PATIENTS.

He steps out carefully, minding the chains... 97. turns a corner, into the LOBBY. It's full-to-bursting with wounded and sickly. Some on the floor. Others on gurneys, shoved against the walls.

Billy, heart pounding through his chest now, just reaches the exit and -- bursts out. WE'RE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE ROAR OF BANGKOK'S Billy, sweating profusely, walks down the sidewalk, fast as the chains will allow ; He glances nervously back at the hospital, keeps walking....
